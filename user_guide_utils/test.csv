Five Stars,As advertised. Reasonably priced
"Outstanding, no complains","Got this shampoo as a solution for my wife's dandruff problem. It worked! She got rid of any dandruff signs after 3-4 uses. As long as she is happy, I am happy too!"
No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its ...,No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its very hard to move around the hair and scalp. It does smell good and my hair feels clean.
Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am ...,Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.
"Dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. ...","It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings"
Five Stars,Outstanding! Top organic shampoo!
I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away."
Five Stars,10 stars right here. This product helped me with my itchy skin and my sister's greasy hair complain.
First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. ...,First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. Worth it for sure. No more struggle with getting rid of my dandruff problem. I use it about once per 2-3 days and it is more than enough to keep my hair and head skin healthy.
One Star,Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin
Worst shampoo Ive ever used,Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!
Disappointment...,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff."
... because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the ...,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money
Five Stars,works great
Scalp-healing,Suffered from itchiness under my hair for couple of years. This product cured the itchiness completely. I took some 4-5 drops of it and then massaged my wet head for a minute approximately. After 2 uses noticed a considerable difference. It definitely gets the job done!
For any type of hair,"Got this product for me and  my daughter. I can say 100% - it works superb on both, long curly and short straight hair."
The best treat for my hair!,Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.
Four Stars,Good but kind of drying
Great for psoriasis,"My psoriasis has been a lot less irritated now that I am swapping in this shampoo to replace my other shampoo every other wash. Not only is my hair cleaner, but my psoriasis is a lot less flared up. I am very happy with this shampoo."
Five Stars,Really good one my head feels really relaxed after chemical shampoos it's pretty big bottle.thanks for inventor.
Five Stars,The best one Ive ever used!!!
I was super excited to see the 5 star review,"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry."
Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works,I have a dry scalp and occasional dandruff. This product really helps! Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works.
Awesome quality!,"Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times."
Great product.,"Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders."
"The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water","This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false "
but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and ...,"It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use."
It didn't work for my psoriasis,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.
Dont buy,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.
Beware,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.
Two Stars,Doesnt smell
One Star,"Throwing it away, burned my scalp."
Skip it,"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant."
Meh,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff."
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels ...,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust."
A really good gentle cleanser,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed."
Don't Waste Your Money On This Crap,"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!"
Irritated my scalp on first use,"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews."
Five Stars,Great smell and products.
Love this product,Love this product. It is the only thing that has worked on my flaky scalp. Not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant in comparison to other products.
Three Stars,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair
Second time buying,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
Really great shampoo for sensitive skin that happens to fix dandruff,"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!"
Two Stars,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.
Great gift!,Came on time. She will love it!
It smells like artificial bananas,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money."
BETTER THAN RAINBATH,I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon
"Not overpowering, but lasts all day",Love this perfume. Light and feminine and doesn't give me a headache like many other fragrances.
Five Stars,Love this product because of the way it makes my hair feel and look.
Polytar  Shampoo,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."
Frizz be gone,I love this shampoo!!!!!!
This is perfect for guests,I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product
Good product,Husband loves it.... Uses it to wash his locs
Five Stars,Love this shampoo.  I have been using it for years...keeps the yellow out of gray hair.
Five Stars,love this shampoo
Five Stars,"Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin"
Five Stars,love it. will continue to use all products from herline
Great exfoliator,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon."
I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch,I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.
Worth the dollars,My husband loves this soap and I love how it makes him smell. Worth the dollars!
Good products,My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!
Highly recommend!,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!"
Five Stars,Excellent product.
Five Stars,thanks
Not Available anymore!!!,This is one of the BEST shampoos for swimmers. I always got complements on my hair since I started using this product. Unavailable now.

Thank you for providing the product for me.
All Biolage products are wonderful.
Thank you!"
flawless,"This pressed powder goes on like silk, so light weight but covers well. I don't like to use a heavy powder that shows all the wrinkles, this one is just right!"

Love it,What the hubby wanted
Highly Recommend,"Took care of my flaky scalp, a problem I've had for years."
My hair looks beautiful after just two washes,"This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again. The smell is not great, but you'll look past it to save your scalp. It is one of the only products that is 100% truly organic. No added chemicals. Very gentle and effective. I highly recommend this product."
Good hair product for dry coarse hair,Have been using the product since I got my first as a gift and I like it.  I have dry coarse hair and it helps to soften it and take away the dullness.

"Excellent shampoo, stopped my hair loss, makes my hair soft and silky.","Very pleased with Uhuru Naturals Hair Growth Shampoo.  It stopped my hair loss, and adds volume.  My hair has even developed waves that it never had before, plus it's soft and silky. I'll certainly buy more of this excellent shampoo when I finish the bottle I have now.  I've already recommended it to friends. This shampoo is gentle to my baby fine hair and leaves it really clean."

But a friend advice me to try this one because my skin started to smell pretty bad during certain  times of the month.  Causes no irritation and I was able to use it everyday.  Seems to get rid of the oily smell from my face.

Ultimate Kors,This is one of the most beautiful lotions I have ever used. Compliments on a daily basis! It is so soft and smooth. Love it!
Five Stars,Great product and good service.
great conditioner but please make a larger bottle,"I'm 63 with still nice hair but so much less than when I was younger, before menopause, so I bought both the shampoo and this conditioner to help strengthen and grow my hair possibly thicker again...the shampoo made my hair feel so stiff it was hard to push my fingers thru my scalp, I wasn't happy, but rinsed and put in this conditioner..........WOW..... my hair turned into silk.....my scalp felt cool like there is mint in the conditioner.....hope it works, I will stick it out because of the conditioner.....I also never understand when a company make the shampoo bottle larger than the conditioner bottle...we all use more conditioner than shampoo, ..i will update in a couple of months"
Five Stars,"love this shampoo, came very quickly, thank you."

Beautiful and Unusual Hair Decor,"Looks very well-made and colors are rich.  A bit larger than I expected (shame on me for not looking at dimensions), but I think it will look lovely in my daughter's hair."
Awesome product for frizzy hair,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair
Five Stars,always good to freshen up when traveling
Good Product!,"Great smell and good product. I don't know that it moisturizes our daughters hair as much as we'd like, but the Tangle Taming Conditioner is a good follow-up for this shampoo."

Shampoo,Received product in a timely fashion and am pleased.
Excellent product!,By far the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have used.  As someone with very thick and dry hair it has given me back the shine and texture I craved.
Really improves the condition of your hair,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
Five Stars,Seems to work as usual.

Cooling,I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair
Five Stars,Smells very nice.
Good stuff,"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone."

"Bought for traveling, but will use daily.","I am an avid hair-straightener. I bought this to serve as my travel straightener, and it will actually become my daily user. It is so sleek and nice. The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove.

Four Stars,"good, happy with the product and price"
Best product for dry or aging hair.,Would not use any other conditioner.  I use it at least every 2 weeks to keep my white hair shining and healthy!
keeps my white hair from looking yellow.,"The silver shampoo I had been using is no longer available, so I tried this. It does a great job as far as color goes but didn't leave my hair as soft.

Makes my coarse hair soft,"Love this shampoo. I first bought it years ago from Sally's Beauty Supply. I have very coarse hair.

Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable,"Purchased this product after researching products to help my son with his three year old daughters naturally curly blonde hair. The baby shampoos he had used were drying her hair out, and most of the detanglers weighted down her curls too much. Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable, not dried out, and has the natural bouncy curls that are adorable."

Five Stars,Awesome product
Best Ever,I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.
Good for mixed hair,Great shampoo for my 2 year old he has mixed hair
White Rain is an old and trusted shampoo for me,Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.
"Have been using for a decade, will use forever","It was scary when Tigi stopped making this stuff, and we were all scrambling to buy whatever was left online  now I guess they're making it again, so thank god.  They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.  I even gifted some to my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, because he loves using mine so much."
I cannot express enough how much I love this brand,"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo."
Our best choice product,"My wife and me have used this shampoo for a long time. Our best choice product.
I have worried my hair loss but this shampoo helpful on my hair."
Four Stars,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.

They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down."
Soothing and Spicy,"Warm, soothing and a little spicy. This zum bar soap is perfect for fall weather. The creamy goat milk base makes it very moisturizing. I'm in love with all the zum bar soaps and keep trying new ones. This scent is the most comforting so far. I give these soaps away as gifts as well. This one would make a great holiday gift because of the frankincense and myrrh.

~The Rebecca Review"
Met all my expectations,100% natural and organic and performes much better than chemical counterparts for the same price.
Wonderful product,I am allergic to a lot of things. I occasionally get a red rash over my body after using some other body washes. This one is an exception. Not a single complain. Perfect!
My wife absolutely loves it,"So, 5 stars it is."
Love this shower gel,"Smells great and performs great. Will buy it again, definitely"

"Cleanest feel, soaps up well and lasts over a month!","I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one."

Five Stars,Nice!!
Wonderful Fresh Scent,"Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling."
Hate to see it go,"I'm devastated that this fragrance has been discontinued. I would love to see P&G bring it back, even if as an occasional ""anniversary"" run; I'd scoop up extras.

Excellent.,Good deal
A favorite shower bathing gel.,Tried many but this is the one to buy.
My favorite shower gel.,"This is a delicious luxury that I have been enjoying for many years. There is no other aroma like it. Makes me feel like a pasha, and want to break out my safari hat. Thanks to Amazon I no longer have trouble finding it. A dime sized dollop goes a long way, so even the smaller container lasts quite a long time."
and I'm now a happy fox.,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox."
Five Stars,Very good
The lavender & thyme are a great combo,Smells wonderful and lathers nicely.  Like all Andalou products you know its good for your skin and works well too. I purchase many skin products from this company and like the quality.
Great,"Before i used this my main Body wash was Old Spice, after i started using this and feels refreshing and clean I like to go between the other kinds of Dial Soap over all happy with the product."
Five Stars,thank you
Five Stars,thank you
Five Stars,I love the scent.
Fine body wash.,"This body wash is expensive because it's hard to find in a lot of places. I was lucky enough to find a few bottle at a retailer near me. This is a great body wash it lathers and cleans well and doesn't seem to drying, it leaves a nice cologne like sent on your skin."
This product makes you love life first thing in the morning.,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day."
Great,Was looking everywhere for this as a gift.  Great scent1
Five Stars,Absolutely...exactly as described
Five Stars,"I used its works, I is good"
Party Like a Rockstar!,"Man, I wish Axe never got rid of this scent. It's really awesome. It's perfect for those Friday and Saturday nights that you're going out. A perfect blend of warm woods and leather, awesome fragrance."

consistently great body wash,"Tree Hut has so far not sold me a product I do not love. The Kiwi body wash is mild and fragrant and cleanses well. You don't need much to clean your entire surface, so it's worth the extra price of buying from this company. Very high-quality and I will continue to buy from Tree Hut."

Great fresh scent!,"Love this product! The scent is subtle, fresh and it leaves your skin feeling soft."
Five Stars,Nice fruity fragrance!
Five Stars,Mom loves it!!
Love it!,Great shower gel--love the scent!
Best soaking liquid ever.,The best soaking liquid you'll find.  I lived in Germany for quite some time and camomile was always recommended for skin irritations and dryness.  This Herbaflor is excellent and will leave your body soft and relaxed.  Stores that I would usually buy it from either don't carry it or no longer exist.  I also love that it leaves the bath tub with no residue.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.
Five Stars,Very good product----I use it every day
I love this body wash,"I love this body wash! It's smells like something delicious, but tastes a little funny. It's also great for pulling pranks on your friends because the body wash looks just like blood!!! Highly recommend this product."
Five Stars,"It was good, my loved her gift!"
Five Stars,Boyfriend's mom LOVED it!!!
Alternative To This Product,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"
Five Stars,Amazing product!
Five Stars,What I expected Nice
Love this product,"Love this product!  It's very nearly good as lanolin products.  It you want to avoid lanolin, it's the way to go!  (P.s.- Their stretch mark cream is awesome)"

Can't go wrong with oil of Olay,"My favorite body wash, suds up nice, leaves skin moisturized and has a nice subtle scent"
Five Stars,It was just what I wanted.
Five Stars,THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHOWER GEL.
Great Fragrance!,"Hi, I don't believe they are still selling this Azur brand. Sorry for the late review, but this was a great gift for my wife and she loved the fragrance. We look forward to buying something similar."

Five Stars,Amazing! Instant relaxation.
This is my family's favorite body wash,"This is my family's favorite body wash, and I was excited to find it on Amazon, as the store I used to purchase it from no longer carries it. Wonderful smell and relaxing smell without being perfume-y; works great for showers to feel clean and for baths to relax."
This bath gel is amazing. Silky smooth and not drying to the skin ...,"This bath gel is amazing. Silky smooth and not drying to the skin after a bath. Lathers very well. A little goes a long way, and it's totally pure and natural. Too bad the price on Amazon went up. Forced to buy else where."
consistently great body wash,"Tree Hut has so far not sold me a product I do not love. The Kiwi body wash is mild and fragrant and cleanses well. You don't need much to clean your entire surface, so it's worth the extra price of buying from this company. Very high-quality and I will continue to buy from Tree Hut."
Just what I wanted- this is my 3rd bottle. ...,Just what I wanted- this is my 3rd bottle. I hope it will still be available next time I need more.

Five Stars,Awesome!!
Five Stars,Gift for sister. She loves it
"The soap is great, I only wish it was available in stores","The soap is great, I only wish it was available in stores.  It's a little on the pricey side considering it's from Dial, and not some French, or Italian desinger, but when you seemingly can only get it online it's worth it."
Great fresh scent!,"Love this product! The scent is subtle, fresh and it leaves your skin feeling soft."
Five Stars,Nice fruity fragrance!
Five Stars,Mom loves it!!
Love it!,Great shower gel--love the scent!
Best soaking liquid ever.,The best soaking liquid you'll find.  I lived in Germany for quite some time and camomile was always recommended for skin irritations and dryness.  This Herbaflor is excellent and will leave your body soft and relaxed.  Stores that I would usually buy it from either don't carry it or no longer exist.  I also love that it leaves the bath tub with no residue.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.
Five Stars,Very good product----I use it every day
I love this body wash,"I love this body wash! It's smells like something delicious, but tastes a little funny. It's also great for pulling pranks on your friends because the body wash looks just like blood!!! Highly recommend this product."
Five Stars,"It was good, my loved her gift!"
Five Stars,Boyfriend's mom LOVED it!!!
Alternative To This Product,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"
Five Stars,Amazing product!
Five Stars,What I expected Nice
Love this product,"Love this product!  It's very nearly good as lanolin products.  It you want to avoid lanolin, it's the way to go!  (P.s.- Their stretch mark cream is awesome)"
Five Stars,As advertised. Reasonably priced

Gentle product,Very gentle effect and very nice smell. Recommended.
Great and natural,"Wow, this product really is purely organic and natural! Outstanding vegan ingredient list and no chemical additives. Works perfect, suits my dry hair."
Great,Really great shampoo. It smells good and leaves hair healthy. Amazing to feel that I've finally found a suitable product
I really like that this product is paraben-free,"I really like that this product is paraben-free, but the execution falls flat on its face. The bottle is tiny for the price. Money-to-value ratio is terrible. To add to that, the actual product itself is very thin and feels watered-down. To be fair, that may be the lack of additives, but it leads to over-use of the gel to get adequate coverage and actually feel clean after using it. To top it off, it really doesn't smell very good, either."
Selenium is awesome!,"Got both products from this seller, shampoo and body wash. Both - top notch. 5 stars"
Very good for me,"Amazing for solving dandruff issues. 2-3 times of use and already got very good results. Pleasant smell, as well. Recommended."
maybe my dandruff is a little bit better. It is a thick shampoo and I do ...,"I bought this in hopes that it would help me get rid of this dandruff that began over winter that for some reason I am unable to get rid of. However it didn't do much, maybe my dandruff is a little bit better. It is a thick shampoo and I do like that it bubble good and smells decent. My hair just doesn't feel clean afterwards no matter how much I scrub."
"Outstanding, no complains","Got this shampoo as a solution for my wife's dandruff problem. It worked! She got rid of any dandruff signs after 3-4 uses. As long as she is happy, I am happy too!"
No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its ...,No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its very hard to move around the hair and scalp. It does smell good and my hair feels clean.
Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am ...,Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.
"Dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. ...","It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings"
Five Stars,Outstanding! Top organic shampoo!
I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away."
Five Stars,10 stars right here. This product helped me with my itchy skin and my sister's greasy hair complain.
First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. ...,First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. Worth it for sure. No more struggle with getting rid of my dandruff problem. I use it about once per 2-3 days and it is more than enough to keep my hair and head skin healthy.
One Star,Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin
Five Stars,loved this scent unfortunately can't get it anymore.
Worst shampoo Ive ever used,Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!
Disappointment...,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff."
... because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the ...,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money
Five Stars,"Great gel, it is organic and smell so good, natural!!!"
Five Stars,works great
Scalp-healing,Suffered from itchiness under my hair for couple of years. This product cured the itchiness completely. I took some 4-5 drops of it and then massaged my wet head for a minute approximately. After 2 uses noticed a considerable difference. It definitely gets the job done!
For any type of hair,"Got this product for me and  my daughter. I can say 100% - it works superb on both, long curly and short straight hair."
Great!,"Great body wash for sensitive skin. Definitely works for me. Leaves skin moisturized and clean. Will repurchase for sure.
PS: the candy scent is very pleasant as well."
The best treat for my hair!,Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.
"I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid","I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid.  It smells good but the bottle will be gone in 2 weeks because of how thin it is.  I haven't used much, maybe I can return it."
Four Stars,Good but kind of drying
Great for psoriasis,"My psoriasis has been a lot less irritated now that I am swapping in this shampoo to replace my other shampoo every other wash. Not only is my hair cleaner, but my psoriasis is a lot less flared up. I am very happy with this shampoo."
Five Stars,Really good one my head feels really relaxed after chemical shampoos it's pretty big bottle.thanks for inventor.
Five Stars,The best one Ive ever used!!!
I was super excited to see the 5 star review,"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry."
Five Stars,"Divine smell, cleaning properties and after-use smell! 5/5 stars."
Five Stars,Happy with the product!
Wow,Unexpectedly good. The best smelling shower gel I have ever used. A little bit on the sweet side. But not chemical
Great item,Recommended for anyone interested in getting the best experience from taking a bath or a shower.
Met all my expectations,100% natural and organic and performes much better than chemical counterparts for the same price.
Wonderful product,I am allergic to a lot of things. I occasionally get a red rash over my body after using some other body washes. This one is an exception. Not a single complain. Perfect!
My wife absolutely loves it,"So, 5 stars it is."
Love this shower gel,"Smells great and performs great. Will buy it again, definitely"
Lathers very well,"5-7 drops is enough for the whole body. Very interesting scent. Smells like candies, which is nice."

Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works,I have a dry scalp and occasional dandruff. This product really helps! Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works.
Awesome quality!,"Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times."
Great product.,"Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders."
Five Stars,Lathers well and smells great.
"The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water","This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false "

It didn't work for my psoriasis,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.
Dont buy,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.
One Star,the smell is bad and totally not natural for me
Not sealed!,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.
Beware,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.
Two Stars,Doesnt smell
One Star,"Throwing it away, burned my scalp."
Good light scent,Good light scent. Have received complements from people that I smell nice after using it. 3 stars because bottle is kind of small for a shower gel (size compariso photo attached) and it doesnt really help me wake up in the morning like other products.
Skip it,"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant."
Meh,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff."
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels ...,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust."
A really good gentle cleanser,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed."
Don't Waste Your Money On This Crap,"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!"
Irritated my scalp on first use,"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews."
Five Stars,Great smell and products.

According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed
Love this product,Love this product. It is the only thing that has worked on my flaky scalp. Not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant in comparison to other products.
Three Stars,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair
Second time buying,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
Really great shampoo for sensitive skin that happens to fix dandruff,"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!"
Two Stars,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.
"Awesome product, no doubt","Awesome product, no doubt ! Use it in the morning before run and my skin doesnt irritate, it already gives it 10 out of 10 ! The smell is great, not chemical which makes more sense to be an organic product but does produce a lot of foam ! Love it !"
Great gift!,Came on time. She will love it!
It smells like artificial bananas,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money."
BETTER THAN RAINBATH,I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon
"Not overpowering, but lasts all day",Love this perfume. Light and feminine and doesn't give me a headache like many other fragrances.
Five Stars,Love this product because of the way it makes my hair feel and look.
Five Stars,Great product for relaxing!
Five Stars,"Lovely product and works great, except the artificial coloring :("
Five Stars,Ideal for the guesthouse.
Five Stars,Best perfume smell and products
Polytar  Shampoo,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."
Frizz be gone,I love this shampoo!!!!!!
Five Stars,LOVE THIS
This is perfect for guests,I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product
"Cleanest feel, soaps up well and lasts over a month!","I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one."
Good product,Husband loves it.... Uses it to wash his locs
Five Stars,Love this shampoo.  I have been using it for years...keeps the yellow out of gray hair.

Five Stars,"Love these, wish they weren't so pricey."
Five Stars,"Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin"
Five Stars,Nice!!
Five Stars,love it. will continue to use all products from herline
Wonderful Fresh Scent,"Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling."
Great exfoliator,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon."
Hate to see it go,"I'm devastated that this fragrance has been discontinued. I would love to see P&G bring it back, even if as an occasional ""anniversary"" run; I'd scoop up extras. As it is, I paid 2 1/2 times per bottle in order to gather as many as the budget would allow. Old Spice Foxcrest, you've served our family well."
I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch,I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.
One of the better body wash smells in my opinion,Smells awesome love it!!
This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection,This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection.  They discontinued it in the store.  I always get compliments of the scent on me. :)
Worth the dollars,My husband loves this soap and I love how it makes him smell. Worth the dollars!
Good products,My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!
Highly recommend!,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!"
Best,Best smell by Old Spice so sad they stopped carrying it at most stores but hey they're loss is the Amazon marketplaces gain. Very quick shipping no issues will be buying again
Five Stars,Excellent product.
Five Stars,thanks
Not Available anymore!!!,This is one of the BEST shampoos for swimmers. I always got complements on my hair since I started using this product. Unavailable now.

Five Stars,Great product..
My hair looks beautiful after just two washes,"This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again. The smell is not great, but you'll look past it to save your scalp. It is one of the only products that is 100% truly organic. No added chemicals. Very gentle and effective. I highly recommend this product."

Five Stars,Excellent
great conditioner but please make a larger bottle,"I'm 63 with still nice hair but so much less than when I was younger, before menopause, so I bought both the shampoo and this conditioner to help strengthen and grow my hair possibly thicker again...the shampoo made my hair feel so stiff it was hard to push my fingers thru my scalp, I wasn't happy, but rinsed and put in this conditioner..........WOW..... my hair turned into silk.....my scalp felt cool like there is mint in the conditioner.....hope it works, I will stick it out because of the conditioner.....I also never understand when a company make the shampoo bottle larger than the conditioner bottle...we all use more conditioner than shampoo, ..i will update in a couple of months"
Bath and Body Wash Gels,This is one of my favorite bath and body products. I love the fragrance.
Five Stars,"love this shampoo, came very quickly, thank you."

Beautiful and Unusual Hair Decor,"Looks very well-made and colors are rich.  A bit larger than I expected (shame on me for not looking at dimensions), but I think it will look lovely in my daughter's hair."
Five Stars,Love these Songelle products.  All was good.
Awesome product for frizzy hair,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair
Five Stars,always good to freshen up when traveling
Good Product!,"Great smell and good product. I don't know that it moisturizes our daughters hair as much as we'd like, but the Tangle Taming Conditioner is a good follow-up for this shampoo."

Excellent.,Good deal
Five Stars,Very nice fragrance.
A favorite shower bathing gel.,Tried many but this is the one to buy.
Five Stars,makes hair smell really good
My favorite shower gel.,"This is a delicious luxury that I have been enjoying for many years. There is no other aroma like it. Makes me feel like a pasha, and want to break out my safari hat. Thanks to Amazon I no longer have trouble finding it. A dime sized dollop goes a long way, so even the smaller container lasts quite a long time."
and I'm now a happy fox.,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox."
Five Stars,Very good
Nice hair product.,I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.
My favorite shampoo,To me this shampoo has to best smell. It cleans very well without drying my hair out. My favorite shampoo.
Five Stars,"Great stuff, wish I could find more"
The Best!,Love this shampoo! Recommended by a friend! Color really lasts!
gentle but gets all the crap off. so happy to see it available stateside ...,ive been using this cleanser for a few years now. i only found it in korea and brought a few tubes every time i visit (once a year). gentle but gets all the crap off. so happy to see it available stateside now.
The best scrub,"So excited to see this on amazon! I found this hem while traveling and couldn't find it anywhere when I got him, this scrub is seriously the best. Gentle and effective."
Good Stuff!,Good Stuff!
The lavender & thyme are a great combo,Smells wonderful and lathers nicely.  Like all Andalou products you know its good for your skin and works well too. I purchase many skin products from this company and like the quality.
love this stuff,Love this stuff - i'm on my second order. Started to get thinning hair. now there's whisps where there wasn't any and hair feels thicker all over.
Best stuff ever,Best stuff ever!  Makes my hair less frizzy when using with a flat iron.  Makes it soft & silky.  Highly recommend!
Smells great!,I love the smell of this body wash! It doesn't dry out my skin either!
Great,"Before i used this my main Body wash was Old Spice, after i started using this and feels refreshing and clean I like to go between the other kinds of Dial Soap over all happy with the product."
Five Stars,best for keratin treatments
Five Stars,thank you
Five Stars,thank you
Four Stars,It worked very well i disliked nothing
Shampoo,Received product in a timely fashion and am pleased.
Five Stars,I love the scent.
Excellent product!,By far the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have used.  As someone with very thick and dry hair it has given me back the shine and texture I craved.
Really improves the condition of your hair,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
Five Stars,Seems to work as usual.
This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon ...,"This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon anymore, you can only find it online. It is a great product if you are looking for a shine. It did not work well as an anti-frizz product."
Five Stars,Leaves your hair full of volume and smells great

Five Stars,Perfect size.
Love the scent and it work better than any other ...,"Love  the scent and it work better than any other mousse I have used. it makes my hair look natural, not stiff. My hair is shinier and fuller. Great stuff."
This product makes you love life first thing in the morning.,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day."
Great,Was looking everywhere for this as a gift.  Great scent1
Tan and Beautiful!,I got s beautiful tan with no burning!  The smell was great too.  Thanks Amazon for carying this product; I am definitely going to order this product again.

Party Like a Rockstar!,"Man, I wish Axe never got rid of this scent. It's really awesome. It's perfect for those Friday and Saturday nights that you're going out. A perfect blend of warm woods and leather, awesome fragrance."
Wonderful!,I love it! I wish the conditioner was still available
Great for every day use.,It makes your scalp tingle and does a great job of cleaning your hair.
Love it,"Have used this for over a month and I love it! No more itching or burning of my skin. Along with the Olay Age Defying moisturizer, my skin feels smooth and non-greasy. Lovely light scent too."
No more yellow hair,This keeps my silver hair looking silvery (rather than yellow).  I reorder this on a regular basis.
Five Stars,Been a fave for decades

Cooling,I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair
Five Stars,Smells very nice.
Good stuff,"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone."

"Bought for traveling, but will use daily.","I am an avid hair-straightener. I bought this to serve as my travel straightener, and it will actually become my daily user. It is so sleek and nice. The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."

keeps my white hair from looking yellow.,"The silver shampoo I had been using is no longer available, so I tried this. It does a great job as far as color goes but didn't leave my hair as soft.

Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable,"Purchased this product after researching products to help my son with his three year old daughters naturally curly blonde hair. The baby shampoos he had used were drying her hair out, and most of the detanglers weighted down her curls too much. Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable, not dried out, and has the natural bouncy curls that are adorable."

Best soaking liquid ever.,The best soaking liquid you'll find.  I lived in Germany for quite some time and camomile was always recommended for skin irritations and dryness.  This Herbaflor is excellent and will leave your body soft and relaxed.  Stores that I would usually buy it from either don't carry it or no longer exist.  I also love that it leaves the bath tub with no residue.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.

Five Stars,Boyfriend's mom LOVED it!!!
one of the best conditioner I have ever used,super conditioner
Best Pantene Product Out There,Best product Pantene made and can't find it in stores anymore.
Alternative To This Product,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"
love it!,Love this product! I use as a night cream and wake up with a soft refreshed feeling.
Five Stars,"I like how it works on my haur, have it looking great."
Five Stars,Amazing product!
Five Stars,Great product great price
Five Stars,Awesome product
Best Ever,I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.
Good for mixed hair,Great shampoo for my 2 year old he has mixed hair
White Rain is an old and trusted shampoo for me,Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.
"Have been using for a decade, will use forever","It was scary when Tigi stopped making this stuff, and we were all scrambling to buy whatever was left online  now I guess they're making it again, so thank god.  They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.  I even gifted some to my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, because he loves using mine so much."
I cannot express enough how much I love this brand,"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo."
Five Stars,What I expected Nice
Our best choice product,"My wife and me have used this shampoo for a long time. Our best choice product.
I have worried my hair loss but this shampoo helpful on my hair."
Four Stars,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.

They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down."
Love this product,"Love this product!  It's very nearly good as lanolin products.  It you want to avoid lanolin, it's the way to go!  (P.s.- Their stretch mark cream is awesome)"
Salve(ation),"My wife uses this for skin irritation (and prevention) and swears by it. A little goes a long way so this product is a good value.

Works fine but gets a little too hot,Works well but gets a little too hot.  Tend to scaled my scalp pretty quickly.  But I use it anyway cuz this is the only brand I find that offers 3/4 inch size.
Great for your hide.,I don't understand the bad reviews because this is an excellent body wash and it smells nice and subtle. The first time I used this body wash it became one of my favorites. The ingredients are top notch and it makes your skin feel excellent afterwards.
Small Sized Sea Sponge,"This is a small sea sponge for the price. It's decent, you can hold it in your hand easily in the shower. Exfoliates well too. Just keep it in a well-drained spot in the shower to extend it's life."
Functional and comfortable,"Very comfortable. I love the lavender smell. It is subtle and not overpowering. Most of the time, it doesn't put any pressure on my eyes, but sometimes I have to fiddle with it so it fits so the two folds on the inside sit just right without irritating me. It blocks out all the light and I do like how smooth the material feels against my face."
Decent Nail Brush,"I used and am reviewing the Nail Brush. I had not realized that the reviews for so many different products would be mixed up on
one page.
The nail brush isn't anything extra special, but it is sturdy and well made. I had no bristles fall out while I was using it.
It did what it was supposed to do, get dirt out from under my fingernails.
If it exfoliated my cuticles in the process, I did not notice. I am not too fussy about my nails and cuticles, only caring if my nails are
broken or dirty."
Moisturizing,Great for an at home spa experience. I have dry heels and these moisturizing booties really helped. Five stars.
Gloves do a Mediocre Job,"It's kind of an odd mix of reviews here. Evidently, there have been multiple listings and products used under this number so that there are multiple items being reviewed. I am reviewing the exfoliating gloves. They are mediocre. They are just a little rough and are good for things like legs and your back, at least the parts you can reach! The gloves are nothing super special and eventually, they get a little gross. You have to keep them clean as well and let them dry completely otherwise they will go yucky."
Too big to be usable (for me).,"This might have been a nice product if they had been a usable size.  Even accounting for wiggling wet hands into fabric, these are oversized.  They should be clearly labeled as EXTRA LARGE and their should be a smaller version as an option.  Offering at least two sizes (S/M and L/XL) seems a fair expectation.  Without size options, I expect the size to be ""medium"" not extra large.  This is neither one-size-fits-all or one-size-fits-most.

If your hands are small, these are unusable.  If your hands are average, you will still find this big.

Fabric is soft and washable."
Unknown and misidentified materials,"These are typical inexpensive spa accessories, good for several uses but not particularly durable, in the case of the moisturizing gloves, and very susceptible to mold and mildew, in the case of the bath mitts.

The moisturizing gloves are stretchy, so they fit almost any adult hand and stay on all night.  They are made of  90% unbleached cotton with Spandex.

The body-loving bath mitt has a terry made of rayon (so-called bamboo fiber that is claimed to be naturally antibacterial, but which is neither) on one side for gentle smoothing and jute loops on the other for more aggressive exfoliation.

The boucl mitt has a stretchy, open weave of unidentified fiber to provide moderate exfoliation.

They are all slightly better than dollar store quality, but definitely not up to what I would expect from Pr de Provence.  I would at least expect proper labelling of the materials used in adherence with FTC regulations regarding rayon made from bamboo and no false claims, as a minimum."
I don't think I've ever had a real sponge like this before,"I don't think I've ever had a real sponge like this before, and it's great for having my back scrubbed. It does not irritate my skin, and it feels good. There's one side effect I hadn't thought of - the cat attacked it like it was alive and he was determined to kill it. I had to take it away from him and put it where he couldn't easily get to it. My own little pet skeleton, right?"
Not too coarse or rough,Very nicely priced foot file and gets the job effectively. I'd say that the file isn't particularly coarse so it doesn't feel rough and is effective on both dry or wet skin. Very effective at dry skin removal and starting anew.
The most effective way to moisturize your hands,"These Urban Spa Moisturizing Gloves are a very effective way to moisturize your hands when they're dry and rough from gardening, household chores or dry cold weather. Simply use your favorite oil or moisturizer and then slip on these gloves. They keep the creams or oils on your hands instead of having it get all over the bedding while you sleep. In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

I washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them. The next time I used warm water that seemed to work better, with no detrimental effects to the gloves that I could see. They feel soft and hold up well."
Great pumice stone,"Great pumice stone on a short rope. Somewhat rough, but that is how these things are. Good for working on overly thick skin areas."
Works well to keep your hair dry,"This is a nice shower cap that provides enough room for lots of hair.  My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, and, while it's fine, I have a lot of it.  This keeps it nice and dry, and is pretty comfy.  The print is also cute."
Works well.,"I admit it takes a bit of getting used to having socks on for sleep.  Especially if it is warm.  Which is when you need this product the most, during summer days running around barefooted.  You develop quite the thick-soled hooves!  I was able to do the perfect test as one of these socks slipped off during the night, so I had perfect data.

The foot that kept the sock on WAS smoother, moisturized, and softer.  No two ways about it.

The booties are really just all natural unbleached cotton no-show socks, thin material probably fits all sizes up to a 10.5, Womens.

I used some lovely Judith Krantz moisturizer and slipped on the socks.  A couple of hours later, one was off, I kept it off to see the difference.  And there is a difference.

I absolutely think this will be an enormous help if you have dry, cracked, and/or calloused feet.

Cold wash, hang to dry."
Get the lather of a bath pouf with the softness of a washcloth.,"With the Color Boucle Bath Mitt, I'm able to get the same large amount of soapy lather I normally would with a bath pouf, but with a softer fabric like you'd get using a washcloth. Using this mitt is like washing with an extra large washcloth, but it's not difficult to work with or easy to accidentally drop. Works well!"
Foot file:  Low-end and ineffective,"This foot file is pretty much just an oversized popsicle stick with strips of sandpaper glued to the front and back.  Dont get me wrong  theres nothing high-tech about any foot file, but some are better than others, and this one is about as bare bones as you can get.

While I do indulge in the occasional professional pedicure, Im a big DIY pedi girl.  This foot file doesnt have the right texture to do a decent job of sloughing off dry skin, and you can forget buffing any calluses  its way too wimpy for that!

Bottom Line:  Low-end, ineffective foot file; not recommended."
I'm definitely cleaner after a good scrubbing,"Works great in the shower -- it really makes me feel cleaner after a good scrubbing, and it dries out beautifully.

No remaining odor after it is completely dry.

Robert C. Ross

great shower cap,"This is a great shower cap. I have very long thick hair that I don't want to wash every day, so this is perfect.  It fits my head comfortably and stays in place well.  It does a very good job at keep the water off my hair and even the edges barely get damp.  Overall, It's a very nice shower cap."
Beautiful solution to my constant problem!,"I'm almost afraid to say it, but these gloves come in very handy! I wash my hands all day long, and I don't always have time to reach for hand cream, especially at work. As a result, my cuticles get ragged, my nails get weak, and my hands feel very uncomfortably dry. In the winter, they can even bleed and crack. I've tried putting on a heavy layer of moisturizer under a pair of socks. It works, but it makes me crazy. These gloves are so super -- they fulfill a need in a better way than I anticipated."
"Handy nail brush, gets garden dirt out from under nails","I really like this nail brush from Urban Spa. The curved shape of the wood as well as the bristles makes it easy to grip when scrubbing under my nails. The wood is smooth and has a light finish on it. The thin row of bristles is cut short and it's stiff, so it really gets under the nails to remove garden dirt or anything else. The other side of the brush has a wider row of slightly softer bristles that clean the skin well. The brush dries quickly after use. Shedding is minimal. Overall, this is a handy little nail brush. I find it much easier to use than the plastic ones that are one-sided."
Nice Loofah with Attached Suction Cup,"Review for Loofah:

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did. The loofah arrives a little flat from packaging but swells up nice and round in the water. It is surprisingly soft in the water. It works great with body wash providing lots of suds.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door. It attaches securely and I haven't had any trouble with it slipping or sliding on the glass."
I like the small size,"I really like this loofah, especially the small size.  It's all you need for scrubbing.  One of my main complaints about those huge foot and a half long loofahs is that they never get a chance to dry out properly between showers and soon have ""that"" smell.  You know what I mean - that men's locker room odor.  This one is about 5 inches long and has a little suction cup (and cloth loop) that you can hang to dry.  I actually hang mine on the curtain rod in front of my sunshiny bathroom window and it says fresh.

It comes packaged flat as a pancake but will expand when it comes in contact with water.  This is a no nonsense bath product that I really like."
Makes Soaking In The Tub Extra Nice,"The Urban Spa Microfiber Bath Pillow makes soaking in the tub extra nice and so much more comfortable for my head and neck. Just fill it with air and attach it to the inside of your tub where you plan to rest your head. The microfiber is nicer than the all plastic bath pillows I've used in the past plus it look a lot nicer too. It's great if you're like me and love to just soak in the tub while reading a book or while just relaxing and listening to music (with the radio or stereo a safe distance from the tub of course!).

What a great way to pamper yourself without spending boutique prices to do it!"
It's okay,"Sadly, mine wouldn't stay stuck to my bathtub, so it moved with me whenever I moved, and when I sat up, it bobbed to the top of the water.  No matter how hard I tried, it wouldn't stay suctioned for more then 10 seconds.

The material is nice and it was easy to blow up.  It is very soft to lay on, but you do have to have a place to let it dry, because the material is like a terry cloth material and it absorbs a lot of water.  I would only suggest ordering this if you have a bathtub that is slick, and not dimpled.  Porcelain or ceramic would be best.  Mine is plastic with dimples and that might be one of the reasons it wouldn't stay in place.  The other reason is that the suction cups are pretty flattened and cheap looking."
Nice kit for beginners,"I was surprised that the tools have in this kit are full sized.  My experience of mani-pedicure kits has been tiny little toys that are cute but useless.  I'm putting this kit in my travel bag, so I'll never leave on a trip without it.

This kit is a bit too bulky to throw in a purse; I carry huge purses, and it's still too big.  I also think it's not really practical for an office; how many opportunities in an average office are there to give yourself the kind of pedicure in which toe separators and a callous file would be involved?

Still, this is almost the perfect travel kit.  It's a great start, and there's plenty of room in the storage bag for add-ins, like cuticle remover, a bottle of polish, and some polish remover wipes."
Not effective,"This is for the eye pillow since Amazon has a ton of unrelated items lumped here under a single spot for reviews.

There were two issues we had wtih this - first, the velcro straps that you can adjust at the back of the head - makes it a bit uncomfortable there especially if you're laying on your back.  Second, this does a poor job of blocking light.  The nose piece isn't cut out nearly enough to allow this to actually rest well over the eyes, so there's just far, far too much light bleed since it just can't fit well.

Scent is pleasant though and ""renewable"" by crinkling the eye pieces."
Simple and precise,Good strong wooden handle that is easy to use. Solid file surface that gets rid of dead skin without feeling any pain. The file is thin enough for easy storage and also will bend to for easier use.
Eye Spa,The eye mask does a good job of blocking out light and the delightful aroma of lavender makes for a very peaceful experience.  Using this is like a mental trip to a spa.  The lavender is a nice added touch that is as gentle to the nose as the mask is to the eyes.  It is also easy to clean and keep clean.  I had one of these several years ago.
Great Hair Do Protection,"Very nice shower cap. This cap has ample room and will not squish down your hair or wreck a hairdo. Moisture is my hair's greatest enemy, but no moisture here. My hot roller 'do' stays full and bouncy."
Gentle and Effective Foot File,This foot file is great. I used it only for my feet. I have diabetes so taking good care of my feet is high priority for me.  I do have a battery operated one already but this one is so convenient for travel and when the batteries start to run out. I tried it on both of my feet and it was gentle and effective  for work on my calluses.
"Goodbye Rough, Dry Feet","This is a nice pumice stone that fits comfortably right in the hand. It is great for the bottom of the feet, and works perfectly to smooth all the rough patches away. I like the little loop of ribbon at the top, as it makes it easy to hang it right on the shower caddy or a hook. This allows it to conveniently air dry after use. Sometimes, pumice stones are so rough that it makes them difficult to hold (as they can scratch up your inner hand and fingers when you are using them). But that is not true with this Urban Spa pumice. It has just enough roughness to be a perfect foil for roughness, without causing any damage to your hands. I love it."
Thin and somewhat flimsy materials. More of a single use kit than permanent use kit,"I'm not crazy about this kit as a whole. It's really basic and a bit flimsy, but it does work for simple maintenance. The emory board works ok and does smooth uneven nail edges. The little buff brush works as well, but it's thin plastic and can bend. The little toe separation foam thing is pretty much a one use item - one piece bent as soon as I used it. The foot/heel file thing does work on mild dry areas, but again it's thin and heavy use probably is not a great idea. I consider this to be similar quality to a travel kit like your hotel provides free of charge - not a daily use kit."
Single shower mitt,"This review is for the ""Urban Spa Boucle Bath Mitt For Shower, Bath, Exfoliating and Cleansing"" - basically a bath mitt with a natural boucl yarn.
You only get one mitt which has a soft exfoliating surface that is less harsh than a loofah yet still exfoliates effectively.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

Overall - this is a decent mitt but nothing spectacular.  I've used products from my local stores that are as good or better for perhaps less price.  It does work and it does leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I would recommend it with reservations."
Works Well - Has Gripper Surface,"Urban Spa Get a Grip Trio Manicure and Pedicure kit is a typical set of tweezers,clippers and small scissors with the added element of blue gripping material. My one complaint is on the tweezers it needs grip on both sides not just one. In order to use without pain from the sharp angles of the large size of the tweezers I turned it around backwards from how I usually hold it. It was hurting my hand to use it what I consider to be the right direction. The gripper on the tweezers and the scissors helps the tools not slip or slide. Rating 4 stars = Like It due to the design flaw with the tweezers. I also like the blue so this is acceptable for use by my husband and sons."
You can't go wrong with a quality nail brush,"Everyone has a need for a nail brush. On the top of the unit, you get a tight row of curved bristles, which are great for getting under your nails. The bottom is all brush and you can use it to remove dead skin and overgrown cuticles. Works best wet and with soap. It is easy to hold. After using, you will want to let it air dry and keep it away from water and steam when you are not using, I say this because I have had to throw more than one bristled brush away because they get mildew when you leave them in a shower."
Standard Shower Cap,"This is a very standard shower cap. It does the job, but it no different from the ones I have purchased over the years from various drugstores. If you are looking for a shower cap, this one is as good as any."
"Bigger than expected, and that is good!","This inflates to an adjustable comfort zone, and has four suctions on the back to stay in place. The cover is terry-like with short soft nap. The size is wide enough to support across the shoulders. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised."
"Nice size, not too big",Nice sponge that's a bit bigger than the size of the palm of your hand. There's a couple of tough spots in it but that's nature. The smaller size is nice as the large ones can be a bit obnoxious. These lather up nicely.
"Not too bad of a file, wished there was a little more grit","I have many tools to help me keep my feet soft in the summer time.  When I wear sandals all day, my heels can get ruff and dry looking so I feel it is important to take proper care of them.  My overall impression of this buffing brush was light way and perhaps not super expensive.  I didn't feel much of a grit difference between the two sides of the brush, I wish one side was grittier than the other side.  I did feel like overall it did a nice job on my heels and pad of my foot.  I typically like to use these dry but you can also use this one wet.  I have used about 4 times and overall the grit is holding up fairly well compared to other files that I have purchased before."
Nice Set For Yourself or Buy As A Gift,"This is a pretty nice little manicure set. All the items are stainless steel. The clippers are small, but have no nail file inside, which I prefer. The scissors are sharp and easy to hold. My favorite are the tweezers. They are very easy to hold and maneuver. All three come with a comfort grip gel coating on parts of the items. Mine set is in white and for me, that's just not practical as far as keeping them looking white for long. This set would make a nice gift too. Recommended."
Gentle.,"This foot file is good as a finishing, smoothing touch after heavy duty foot scrubber. Just by itself it won't take care of calluses."
"Comfortable and combined with hand lotion, great gift idea","Perfect way to add a bit of self care at home rather than the spa or makes a great gift idea. Combine these light little gloves with your favorite hand creme for a delightful gift or pick-me-up. Gloves are comfortable, light weight and easy to put on or take off. Off white and both wide as well as long enough."
Not recommended,"I have often heard about this type of product and I always assumed they would be lined with plastic of some kind, something non-absorbent, because otherwise, your hand cream would soak into the fabric, right?  Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)  As a process I don't recommend this, but if you are willing to deal with the drawbacks, you might like these.  But for me, I'll just keep moisturizing my hands before bed as usual."
Basic foot file,"This is about the same quality foot file as the ones I pick up in the check out aisle.  Half of the useful things in life are in the check out aisle.  The price is pretty comparable.

Generally I end up getting these when I am on the road and don't have a nail file or my Amope pedi device with me or any number of times I end up in a different town that I planned to be.  It happens."
Booties: Not the most comfortable and you have to use lotion to get the moisturizing benefit,"Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well."
Does a better job than the cheese grater type,"This is a great product. I used it after a shower and it did a remarkable job at removing rough spots from my feet.

Thus fits comfortably in the palm and covers a greater surface area than other types of foot smoother.  It glides over curves and contours  without missing a spit. This performs much better Han cheese greater types of tools as well as the eggs.

Great product at a reasonable price."
Good natural sponge,"This is a nice sea sponge; it really does feel good against the skin and it holds shower gel nicely. It's a good size, too -- I have large hands it's a little bigger than the size of my palm, which makes it easy to hold. I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not over-priced (this is a natural sponge, after all), but it's not exactly a steal, either. Still, it's a good buy."
Could be scratchier.,"I'd probably like to have it a bit rougher, were I picking the perfect bath mit.  I mean, it's a similar colour to a loofah, but a loofah feels a little bit scratchier and overall nicer.  It does stretch to fit over my large hand and wrist, but barely.  It's still nice to have though."
Good Exfoliating Gloves,"Near perfect exfoliating gloves my only complaint is a matter of preference rather than product defect.  I prefer harder surface area to use on round areas of the body or potentially harder like the feet, elbows ect. That being said these should accommodate just about anyone's taste while more importantly being effective."
Cute Cap,"this is a cute shower cap. It comes in a little plastic envelope with a snap making it easy to tuck in a suitcase. The teal pattern is pleasant. The cap itself is unlined and made of rather crinkly plastic. The elastic is covered with white plastic. I've been growing out my hair and it is now past my shoulders. I was pleased that this cap was able to accommodate it all. The plastic is waterproof. the cap should fit most head sizes.

I use shower caps when airbrushing makeup and when actually painting the interior of my house as well as for showers and deep conditioning. This one certainly performs as well as any. the pattern is pretty but it is not especially comfortable or well made. especially considering the price point.  It does the job it was designed to do but the quality is on a par with the dollars store or discount beauty supplier."
Works for Combination Skin Conditions,"Avalon Organics has products that I tend to love because they are so natural and deliciously scented. I have combination skin where I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. This cream is not greasy so it is OK for the oily skin and it is moisturizing so it also soothes the dry skin conditions on my face. I have not found this to be irritating like other Vitamin C creams and serums. In fact this seems to calm my skin significantly so it is not overly sensitive. If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin. I love this and hope it works for you too. Always test a bit on your wrist before applying.

Favorite Perfume,"My favorite perfume ever...

I really like that this product is paraben-free,"I really like that this product is paraben-free, but the execution falls flat on its face. The bottle is tiny for the price. Money-to-value ratio is terrible. To add to that, the actual product itself is very thin and feels watered-down. To be fair, that may be the lack of additives, but it leads to over-use of the gel to get adequate coverage and actually feel clean after using it. To top it off, it really doesn't smell very good, either."

I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium.

Awesome quality!,"Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times."
Great product.,"Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders."
Five Stars,Lathers well and smells great.
"The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water","This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false "
but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and ...,"It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use."
It didn't work for my psoriasis,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.
Dont buy,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.
One Star,the smell is bad and totally not natural for me
Not sealed!,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.
Beware,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.
Two Stars,Doesnt smell
One Star,"Throwing it away, burned my scalp."
Good light scent,Good light scent. Have received complements from people that I smell nice after using it. 3 stars because bottle is kind of small for a shower gel (size compariso photo attached) and it doesnt really help me wake up in the morning like other products.
Skip it,"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant."
Meh,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff."
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels ...,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust."
A really good gentle cleanser,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed."
Don't Waste Your Money On This Crap,"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!"
Irritated my scalp on first use,"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews."
Five Stars,Great smell and products.
According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up ...,Wow I was totally hyped to try this shower gel. According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed
Love this product,Love this product. It is the only thing that has worked on my flaky scalp. Not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant in comparison to other products.
Three Stars,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair
Second time buying,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
Really great shampoo for sensitive skin that happens to fix dandruff,"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!"
Two Stars,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.
"Awesome product, no doubt","Awesome product, no doubt ! Use it in the morning before run and my skin doesnt irritate, it already gives it 10 out of 10 ! The smell is great, not chemical which makes more sense to be an organic product but does produce a lot of foam ! Love it !"
Great gift!,Came on time. She will love it!
It smells like artificial bananas,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money."
BETTER THAN RAINBATH,I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon
"Not overpowering, but lasts all day",Love this perfume. Light and feminine and doesn't give me a headache like many other fragrances.
Five Stars,Love this product because of the way it makes my hair feel and look.
Five Stars,Great product for relaxing!
Five Stars,"Lovely product and works great, except the artificial coloring :("
Five Stars,Ideal for the guesthouse.
Five Stars,Best perfume smell and products
Polytar  Shampoo,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."
Frizz be gone,I love this shampoo!!!!!!
Five Stars,LOVE THIS
This is perfect for guests,I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product
"Cleanest feel, soaps up well and lasts over a month!","I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one."
Good product,Husband loves it.... Uses it to wash his locs
Five Stars,Love this shampoo.  I have been using it for years...keeps the yellow out of gray hair.

Five Stars,"Love these, wish they weren't so pricey."
Five Stars,"Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin"
Five Stars,Nice!!
Five Stars,love it. will continue to use all products from herline
Wonderful Fresh Scent,"Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling."
Great exfoliator,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon."
Hate to see it go,"I'm devastated that this fragrance has been discontinued. I would love to see P&G bring it back, even if as an occasional ""anniversary"" run; I'd scoop up extras. As it is, I paid 2 1/2 times per bottle in order to gather as many as the budget would allow. Old Spice Foxcrest, you've served our family well."
I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch,I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.
One of the better body wash smells in my opinion,Smells awesome love it!!
This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection,This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection.  They discontinued it in the store.  I always get compliments of the scent on me. :)
Worth the dollars,My husband loves this soap and I love how it makes him smell. Worth the dollars!
Good products,My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!
Highly recommend!,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!"
Best,Best smell by Old Spice so sad they stopped carrying it at most stores but hey they're loss is the Amazon marketplaces gain. Very quick shipping no issues will be buying again
Five Stars,Excellent product.
Five Stars,thanks
Not Available anymore!!!,This is one of the BEST shampoos for swimmers. I always got complements on my hair since I started using this product. Unavailable now.

Five Stars,Great product..
My hair looks beautiful after just two washes,"This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again. The smell is not great, but you'll look past it to save your scalp. It is one of the only products that is 100% truly organic. No added chemicals. Very gentle and effective. I highly recommend this product."
Five Stars,great buy
Five Stars,AAA+

My hair has even developed waves that it never had before, plus it's soft and silky. I'll certainly buy more of this excellent shampoo when I finish the bottle I have now.

Beautiful and Unusual Hair Decor,"Looks very well-made and colors are rich.  A bit larger than I expected (shame on me for not looking at dimensions), but I think it will look lovely in my daughter's hair."
Five Stars,Love these Songelle products.  All was good.
Awesome product for frizzy hair,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair
Five Stars,always good to freshen up when traveling
Good Product!,"Great smell and good product. I don't know that it moisturizes our daughters hair as much as we'd like, but the Tangle Taming Conditioner is a good follow-up for this shampoo."

A favorite shower bathing gel.,Tried many but this is the one to buy.
Five Stars,makes hair smell really good
My favorite shower gel.,"This is a delicious luxury that I have been enjoying for many years. There is no other aroma like it. Makes me feel like a pasha, and want to break out my safari hat. Thanks to Amazon I no longer have trouble finding it. A dime sized dollop goes a long way, so even the smaller container lasts quite a long time."
and I'm now a happy fox.,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox."
Five Stars,Very good
Nice hair product.,I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.
My favorite shampoo,To me this shampoo has to best smell. It cleans very well without drying my hair out. My favorite shampoo.

Five Stars,thank you
Four Stars,It worked very well i disliked nothing
Shampoo,Received product in a timely fashion and am pleased.
Five Stars,I love the scent.
Excellent product!,By far the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have used.  As someone with very thick and dry hair it has given me back the shine and texture I craved.
Really improves the condition of your hair,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
Five Stars,Seems to work as usual.

This product makes you love life first thing in the morning.,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day."
Great,Was looking everywhere for this as a gift.  Great scent1
Tan and Beautiful!,I got s beautiful tan with no burning!  The smell was great too.  Thanks Amazon for carying this product; I am definitely going to order this product again.

Wonderful!,I love it! I wish the conditioner was still available
Great for every day use.,It makes your scalp tingle and does a great job of cleaning your hair.
Love it,"Have used this for over a month and I love it! No more itching or burning of my skin. Along with the Olay Age Defying moisturizer, my skin feels smooth and non-greasy. Lovely light scent too."
No more yellow hair,This keeps my silver hair looking silvery (rather than yellow).  I reorder this on a regular basis.

Cooling,I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair
Five Stars,Smells very nice.
Good stuff,"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone."

"Bought for traveling, but will use daily.","I am an avid hair-straightener. I bought this to serve as my travel straightener, and it will actually become my daily user. It is so sleek and nice. The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."
he says it doesn't dry out his skin and it smells great. I would recommend this body wash,my husband uses this bodywash all the time. he says it doesn't dry out his skin and it smells great. I would recommend this body wash.
Four Stars,"good, happy with the product and price"
Best product for dry or aging hair.,Would not use any other conditioner.  I use it at least every 2 weeks to keep my white hair shining and healthy!
keeps my white hair from looking yellow.,"The silver shampoo I had been using is no longer available, so I tried this. It does a great job as far as color goes but didn't leave my hair as soft. I have very thick coarse hair and it's hard to find a product to soften it. Overall I'm very pleased, especially for the cost."
Five Stars,Love!
Five Stars,"Yeah, the huge size!!!  This stuff has changed my naturally curly hair!"

Makes my coarse hair soft,"Love this shampoo. I first bought it years ago from Sally's Beauty Supply. I have very coarse hair. It leaves it silky smooth and feels like I don't even need conditioner,  which is a first. I like that it doesn't contain phosphates, because that's not something I want to have to worry about. I'm definitely going to purchase this again. Great shampoo!"

Five Stars,use it everyday works great
Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable,"Purchased this product after researching products to help my son with his three year old daughters naturally curly blonde hair. The baby shampoos he had used were drying her hair out, and most of the detanglers weighted down her curls too much. Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable, not dried out, and has the natural bouncy curls that are adorable."
Five Stars,Excellent product

This is my family's favorite body wash,"This is my family's favorite body wash, and I was excited to find it on Amazon, as the store I used to purchase it from no longer carries it.

consistently great body wash,"Tree Hut has so far not sold me a product I do not love. The Kiwi body wash is mild and fragrant and cleanses well. You don't need much to clean your entire surface, so it's worth the extra price of buying from this company. Very high-quality and I will continue to buy from Tree Hut."

Fuller Hair,"Sally's stop selling this great shampoo for fuller thicker hair thanks to this company through Amazon I can buy again. This is a great shampoo if you want to hide that you have thin hair, but this shampoo only gives volume for a few hours."

Works as advertised.,I have very curly hair and always used Mousse products.  I began to have a reaction to the product and tried naturelle.  The gel works well and I have no reaction to the product.  Very glad I found it!
Five Stars,Gift for sister. She loves it
"The soap is great, I only wish it was available in stores","The soap is great, I only wish it was available in stores.  It's a little on the pricey side considering it's from Dial, and not some French, or Italian desinger, but when you seemingly can only get it online it's worth it."

Best soaking liquid ever.,The best soaking liquid you'll find.  I lived in Germany for quite some time and camomile was always recommended for skin irritations and dryness.  This Herbaflor is excellent and will leave your body soft and relaxed.  Stores that I would usually buy it from either don't carry it or no longer exist.  I also love that it leaves the bath tub with no residue.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.

Five Stars,Boyfriend's mom LOVED it!!!
one of the best conditioner I have ever used,super conditioner
Best Pantene Product Out There,Best product Pantene made and can't find it in stores anymore.
Alternative To This Product,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again"
love it!,Love this product! I use as a night cream and wake up with a soft refreshed feeling.
Five Stars,"I like how it works on my haur, have it looking great."
Five Stars,Amazing product!
Five Stars,Great product great price
Five Stars,Awesome product
Best Ever,I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.
Good for mixed hair,Great shampoo for my 2 year old he has mixed hair
White Rain is an old and trusted shampoo for me,Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.
"Have been using for a decade, will use forever","It was scary when Tigi stopped making this stuff, and we were all scrambling to buy whatever was left online  now I guess they're making it again, so thank god.  They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.  I even gifted some to my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, because he loves using mine so much."
I cannot express enough how much I love this brand,"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo."
Five Stars,What I expected Nice
Our best choice product,"My wife and me have used this shampoo for a long time. Our best choice product.
I have worried my hair loss but this shampoo helpful on my hair."
Four Stars,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.
They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone ...,"Finding a ""natural"" shampoo that isn't disappointing is a challenge. They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down."
Love this product,"Love this product!  It's very nearly good as lanolin products.  It you want to avoid lanolin, it's the way to go!  (P.s.- Their stretch mark cream is awesome)"
Five Stars,as advertised
Four Stars,Still does a great pre shave job.
Voodoo,It really works! This gotta be black magic mixed with voodoo water and chicken cum.
Five Stars,Absolutely Love this
Salve(ation),"My wife uses this for skin irritation (and prevention) and swears by it. A little goes a long way so this product is a good value.

~ Kort"
Works fine but gets a little too hot,Works well but gets a little too hot.  Tend to scaled my scalp pretty quickly.  But I use it anyway cuz this is the only brand I find that offers 3/4 inch size.
Great for your hide.,I don't understand the bad reviews because this is an excellent body wash and it smells nice and subtle. The first time I used this body wash it became one of my favorites. The ingredients are top notch and it makes your skin feel excellent afterwards.
Small Sized Sea Sponge,"This is a small sea sponge for the price. It's decent, you can hold it in your hand easily in the shower. Exfoliates well too. Just keep it in a well-drained spot in the shower to extend it's life."
Functional and comfortable,"Very comfortable. I love the lavender smell. It is subtle and not overpowering. Most of the time, it doesn't put any pressure on my eyes, but sometimes I have to fiddle with it so it fits so the two folds on the inside sit just right without irritating me. It blocks out all the light and I do like how smooth the material feels against my face."
Decent Nail Brush,"I used and am reviewing the Nail Brush. I had not realized that the reviews for so many different products would be mixed up on
one page.
The nail brush isn't anything extra special, but it is sturdy and well made. I had no bristles fall out while I was using it.
It did what it was supposed to do, get dirt out from under my fingernails.
If it exfoliated my cuticles in the process, I did not notice. I am not too fussy about my nails and cuticles, only caring if my nails are
broken or dirty."
Moisturizing,Great for an at home spa experience. I have dry heels and these moisturizing booties really helped. Five stars.
Gloves do a Mediocre Job,"It's kind of an odd mix of reviews here. Evidently, there have been multiple listings and products used under this number so that there are multiple items being reviewed. I am reviewing the exfoliating gloves. They are mediocre. They are just a little rough and are good for things like legs and your back, at least the parts you can reach! The gloves are nothing super special and eventually, they get a little gross. You have to keep them clean as well and let them dry completely otherwise they will go yucky."
Too big to be usable (for me).,"This might have been a nice product if they had been a usable size.  Even accounting for wiggling wet hands into fabric, these are oversized.  They should be clearly labeled as EXTRA LARGE and their should be a smaller version as an option.  Offering at least two sizes (S/M and L/XL) seems a fair expectation.  Without size options, I expect the size to be ""medium"" not extra large.  This is neither one-size-fits-all or one-size-fits-most.

If your hands are small, these are unusable.  If your hands are average, you will still find this big.

Fabric is soft and washable."
Unknown and misidentified materials,"These are typical inexpensive spa accessories, good for several uses but not particularly durable, in the case of the moisturizing gloves, and very susceptible to mold and mildew, in the case of the bath mitts.

The moisturizing gloves are stretchy, so they fit almost any adult hand and stay on all night.  They are made of  90% unbleached cotton with Spandex.

The body-loving bath mitt has a terry made of rayon (so-called bamboo fiber that is claimed to be naturally antibacterial, but which is neither) on one side for gentle smoothing and jute loops on the other for more aggressive exfoliation.

The boucl mitt has a stretchy, open weave of unidentified fiber to provide moderate exfoliation.

They are all slightly better than dollar store quality, but definitely not up to what I would expect from Pr de Provence.  I would at least expect proper labelling of the materials used in adherence with FTC regulations regarding rayon made from bamboo and no false claims, as a minimum."
I don't think I've ever had a real sponge like this before,"I don't think I've ever had a real sponge like this before, and it's great for having my back scrubbed. It does not irritate my skin, and it feels good. There's one side effect I hadn't thought of - the cat attacked it like it was alive and he was determined to kill it. I had to take it away from him and put it where he couldn't easily get to it. My own little pet skeleton, right?"
Not too coarse or rough,Very nicely priced foot file and gets the job effectively. I'd say that the file isn't particularly coarse so it doesn't feel rough and is effective on both dry or wet skin. Very effective at dry skin removal and starting anew.
The most effective way to moisturize your hands,"These Urban Spa Moisturizing Gloves are a very effective way to moisturize your hands when they're dry and rough from gardening, household chores or dry cold weather. Simply use your favorite oil or moisturizer and then slip on these gloves. They keep the creams or oils on your hands instead of having it get all over the bedding while you sleep. In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

I washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them. The next time I used warm water that seemed to work better, with no detrimental effects to the gloves that I could see. They feel soft and hold up well."
Great pumice stone,"Great pumice stone on a short rope. Somewhat rough, but that is how these things are. Good for working on overly thick skin areas."
Works well to keep your hair dry,"This is a nice shower cap that provides enough room for lots of hair.  My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, and, while it's fine, I have a lot of it.  This keeps it nice and dry, and is pretty comfy.  The print is also cute."
Works well.,"I admit it takes a bit of getting used to having socks on for sleep.  Especially if it is warm.  Which is when you need this product the most, during summer days running around barefooted.  You develop quite the thick-soled hooves!  I was able to do the perfect test as one of these socks slipped off during the night, so I had perfect data.

The foot that kept the sock on WAS smoother, moisturized, and softer.  No two ways about it.

The booties are really just all natural unbleached cotton no-show socks, thin material probably fits all sizes up to a 10.5, Womens.

I used some lovely Judith Krantz moisturizer and slipped on the socks.  A couple of hours later, one was off, I kept it off to see the difference.  And there is a difference.

I absolutely think this will be an enormous help if you have dry, cracked, and/or calloused feet.

Cold wash, hang to dry."
Get the lather of a bath pouf with the softness of a washcloth.,"With the Color Boucle Bath Mitt, I'm able to get the same large amount of soapy lather I normally would with a bath pouf, but with a softer fabric like you'd get using a washcloth. Using this mitt is like washing with an extra large washcloth, but it's not difficult to work with or easy to accidentally drop. Works well!"
Foot file:  Low-end and ineffective,"This foot file is pretty much just an oversized popsicle stick with strips of sandpaper glued to the front and back.  Dont get me wrong  theres nothing high-tech about any foot file, but some are better than others, and this one is about as bare bones as you can get.

While I do indulge in the occasional professional pedicure, Im a big DIY pedi girl.  This foot file doesnt have the right texture to do a decent job of sloughing off dry skin, and you can forget buffing any calluses  its way too wimpy for that!

Bottom Line:  Low-end, ineffective foot file; not recommended."
I'm definitely cleaner after a good scrubbing,"Works great in the shower -- it really makes me feel cleaner after a good scrubbing, and it dries out beautifully.

No remaining odor after it is completely dry.

Robert C. Ross
September 2017"
great shower cap,"This is a great shower cap. I have very long thick hair that I don't want to wash every day, so this is perfect.  It fits my head comfortably and stays in place well.  It does a very good job at keep the water off my hair and even the edges barely get damp.  Overall, It's a very nice shower cap."
Beautiful solution to my constant problem!,"I'm almost afraid to say it, but these gloves come in very handy! I wash my hands all day long, and I don't always have time to reach for hand cream, especially at work. As a result, my cuticles get ragged, my nails get weak, and my hands feel very uncomfortably dry. In the winter, they can even bleed and crack. I've tried putting on a heavy layer of moisturizer under a pair of socks. It works, but it makes me crazy. These gloves are so super -- they fulfill a need in a better way than I anticipated."
"Handy nail brush, gets garden dirt out from under nails","I really like this nail brush from Urban Spa. The curved shape of the wood as well as the bristles makes it easy to grip when scrubbing under my nails. The wood is smooth and has a light finish on it. The thin row of bristles is cut short and it's stiff, so it really gets under the nails to remove garden dirt or anything else. The other side of the brush has a wider row of slightly softer bristles that clean the skin well. The brush dries quickly after use. Shedding is minimal. Overall, this is a handy little nail brush. I find it much easier to use than the plastic ones that are one-sided."
Nice Loofah with Attached Suction Cup,"Review for Loofah:

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did. The loofah arrives a little flat from packaging but swells up nice and round in the water. It is surprisingly soft in the water. It works great with body wash providing lots of suds.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door. It attaches securely and I haven't had any trouble with it slipping or sliding on the glass."
I like the small size,"I really like this loofah, especially the small size.  It's all you need for scrubbing.  One of my main complaints about those huge foot and a half long loofahs is that they never get a chance to dry out properly between showers and soon have ""that"" smell.  You know what I mean - that men's locker room odor.  This one is about 5 inches long and has a little suction cup (and cloth loop) that you can hang to dry.  I actually hang mine on the curtain rod in front of my sunshiny bathroom window and it says fresh.

It comes packaged flat as a pancake but will expand when it comes in contact with water.  This is a no nonsense bath product that I really like."
Makes Soaking In The Tub Extra Nice,"The Urban Spa Microfiber Bath Pillow makes soaking in the tub extra nice and so much more comfortable for my head and neck. Just fill it with air and attach it to the inside of your tub where you plan to rest your head. The microfiber is nicer than the all plastic bath pillows I've used in the past plus it look a lot nicer too. It's great if you're like me and love to just soak in the tub while reading a book or while just relaxing and listening to music (with the radio or stereo a safe distance from the tub of course!).

What a great way to pamper yourself without spending boutique prices to do it!"
It's okay,"Sadly, mine wouldn't stay stuck to my bathtub, so it moved with me whenever I moved, and when I sat up, it bobbed to the top of the water.  No matter how hard I tried, it wouldn't stay suctioned for more then 10 seconds.

The material is nice and it was easy to blow up.  It is very soft to lay on, but you do have to have a place to let it dry, because the material is like a terry cloth material and it absorbs a lot of water.  I would only suggest ordering this if you have a bathtub that is slick, and not dimpled.  Porcelain or ceramic would be best.  Mine is plastic with dimples and that might be one of the reasons it wouldn't stay in place.  The other reason is that the suction cups are pretty flattened and cheap looking."
Nice kit for beginners,"I was surprised that the tools have in this kit are full sized.  My experience of mani-pedicure kits has been tiny little toys that are cute but useless.  I'm putting this kit in my travel bag, so I'll never leave on a trip without it.

This kit is a bit too bulky to throw in a purse; I carry huge purses, and it's still too big.  I also think it's not really practical for an office; how many opportunities in an average office are there to give yourself the kind of pedicure in which toe separators and a callous file would be involved?

Still, this is almost the perfect travel kit.  It's a great start, and there's plenty of room in the storage bag for add-ins, like cuticle remover, a bottle of polish, and some polish remover wipes."
Not effective,"This is for the eye pillow since Amazon has a ton of unrelated items lumped here under a single spot for reviews.

There were two issues we had wtih this - first, the velcro straps that you can adjust at the back of the head - makes it a bit uncomfortable there especially if you're laying on your back.  Second, this does a poor job of blocking light.  The nose piece isn't cut out nearly enough to allow this to actually rest well over the eyes, so there's just far, far too much light bleed since it just can't fit well.

Scent is pleasant though and ""renewable"" by crinkling the eye pieces."
Simple and precise,Good strong wooden handle that is easy to use. Solid file surface that gets rid of dead skin without feeling any pain. The file is thin enough for easy storage and also will bend to for easier use.
Eye Spa,The eye mask does a good job of blocking out light and the delightful aroma of lavender makes for a very peaceful experience.  Using this is like a mental trip to a spa.  The lavender is a nice added touch that is as gentle to the nose as the mask is to the eyes.  It is also easy to clean and keep clean.  I had one of these several years ago.
Great Hair Do Protection,"Very nice shower cap. This cap has ample room and will not squish down your hair or wreck a hairdo. Moisture is my hair's greatest enemy, but no moisture here. My hot roller 'do' stays full and bouncy."
Gentle and Effective Foot File,This foot file is great. I used it only for my feet. I have diabetes so taking good care of my feet is high priority for me.  I do have a battery operated one already but this one is so convenient for travel and when the batteries start to run out. I tried it on both of my feet and it was gentle and effective  for work on my calluses.
"Goodbye Rough, Dry Feet","This is a nice pumice stone that fits comfortably right in the hand. It is great for the bottom of the feet, and works perfectly to smooth all the rough patches away. I like the little loop of ribbon at the top, as it makes it easy to hang it right on the shower caddy or a hook. This allows it to conveniently air dry after use. Sometimes, pumice stones are so rough that it makes them difficult to hold (as they can scratch up your inner hand and fingers when you are using them). But that is not true with this Urban Spa pumice. It has just enough roughness to be a perfect foil for roughness, without causing any damage to your hands. I love it."
Thin and somewhat flimsy materials. More of a single use kit than permanent use kit,"I'm not crazy about this kit as a whole. It's really basic and a bit flimsy, but it does work for simple maintenance. The emory board works ok and does smooth uneven nail edges. The little buff brush works as well, but it's thin plastic and can bend. The little toe separation foam thing is pretty much a one use item - one piece bent as soon as I used it. The foot/heel file thing does work on mild dry areas, but again it's thin and heavy use probably is not a great idea. I consider this to be similar quality to a travel kit like your hotel provides free of charge - not a daily use kit."
Single shower mitt,"This review is for the ""Urban Spa Boucle Bath Mitt For Shower, Bath, Exfoliating and Cleansing"" - basically a bath mitt with a natural boucl yarn.
You only get one mitt which has a soft exfoliating surface that is less harsh than a loofah yet still exfoliates effectively.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

Overall - this is a decent mitt but nothing spectacular.  I've used products from my local stores that are as good or better for perhaps less price.  It does work and it does leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I would recommend it with reservations."
Works Well - Has Gripper Surface,"Urban Spa Get a Grip Trio Manicure and Pedicure kit is a typical set of tweezers,clippers and small scissors with the added element of blue gripping material. My one complaint is on the tweezers it needs grip on both sides not just one. In order to use without pain from the sharp angles of the large size of the tweezers I turned it around backwards from how I usually hold it. It was hurting my hand to use it what I consider to be the right direction. The gripper on the tweezers and the scissors helps the tools not slip or slide. Rating 4 stars = Like It due to the design flaw with the tweezers. I also like the blue so this is acceptable for use by my husband and sons."
You can't go wrong with a quality nail brush,"Everyone has a need for a nail brush. On the top of the unit, you get a tight row of curved bristles, which are great for getting under your nails. The bottom is all brush and you can use it to remove dead skin and overgrown cuticles. Works best wet and with soap. It is easy to hold. After using, you will want to let it air dry and keep it away from water and steam when you are not using, I say this because I have had to throw more than one bristled brush away because they get mildew when you leave them in a shower."
Standard Shower Cap,"This is a very standard shower cap. It does the job, but it no different from the ones I have purchased over the years from various drugstores. If you are looking for a shower cap, this one is as good as any."
"Bigger than expected, and that is good!","This inflates to an adjustable comfort zone, and has four suctions on the back to stay in place. The cover is terry-like with short soft nap. The size is wide enough to support across the shoulders. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised."
"Nice size, not too big",Nice sponge that's a bit bigger than the size of the palm of your hand. There's a couple of tough spots in it but that's nature. The smaller size is nice as the large ones can be a bit obnoxious. These lather up nicely.
"Not too bad of a file, wished there was a little more grit","I have many tools to help me keep my feet soft in the summer time.  When I wear sandals all day, my heels can get ruff and dry looking so I feel it is important to take proper care of them.  My overall impression of this buffing brush was light way and perhaps not super expensive.  I didn't feel much of a grit difference between the two sides of the brush, I wish one side was grittier than the other side.  I did feel like overall it did a nice job on my heels and pad of my foot.  I typically like to use these dry but you can also use this one wet.  I have used about 4 times and overall the grit is holding up fairly well compared to other files that I have purchased before."
Nice Set For Yourself or Buy As A Gift,"This is a pretty nice little manicure set. All the items are stainless steel. The clippers are small, but have no nail file inside, which I prefer. The scissors are sharp and easy to hold. My favorite are the tweezers. They are very easy to hold and maneuver. All three come with a comfort grip gel coating on parts of the items. Mine set is in white and for me, that's just not practical as far as keeping them looking white for long. This set would make a nice gift too. Recommended."
Gentle.,"This foot file is good as a finishing, smoothing touch after heavy duty foot scrubber. Just by itself it won't take care of calluses."
"Comfortable and combined with hand lotion, great gift idea","Perfect way to add a bit of self care at home rather than the spa or makes a great gift idea. Combine these light little gloves with your favorite hand creme for a delightful gift or pick-me-up. Gloves are comfortable, light weight and easy to put on or take off. Off white and both wide as well as long enough."
Not recommended,"I have often heard about this type of product and I always assumed they would be lined with plastic of some kind, something non-absorbent, because otherwise, your hand cream would soak into the fabric, right?  Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)  As a process I don't recommend this, but if you are willing to deal with the drawbacks, you might like these.  But for me, I'll just keep moisturizing my hands before bed as usual."
Basic foot file,"This is about the same quality foot file as the ones I pick up in the check out aisle.  Half of the useful things in life are in the check out aisle.  The price is pretty comparable.

Generally I end up getting these when I am on the road and don't have a nail file or my Amope pedi device with me or any number of times I end up in a different town that I planned to be.  It happens."
Booties: Not the most comfortable and you have to use lotion to get the moisturizing benefit,"Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well."
Does a better job than the cheese grater type,"This is a great product. I used it after a shower and it did a remarkable job at removing rough spots from my feet.

Thus fits comfortably in the palm and covers a greater surface area than other types of foot smoother.  It glides over curves and contours  without missing a spit. This performs much better Han cheese greater types of tools as well as the eggs.

Great product at a reasonable price."
Good natural sponge,"This is a nice sea sponge; it really does feel good against the skin and it holds shower gel nicely. It's a good size, too -- I have large hands it's a little bigger than the size of my palm, which makes it easy to hold. I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not over-priced (this is a natural sponge, after all), but it's not exactly a steal, either. Still, it's a good buy."
Could be scratchier.,"I'd probably like to have it a bit rougher, were I picking the perfect bath mit.  I mean, it's a similar colour to a loofah, but a loofah feels a little bit scratchier and overall nicer.  It does stretch to fit over my large hand and wrist, but barely.  It's still nice to have though."
Good Exfoliating Gloves,"Near perfect exfoliating gloves my only complaint is a matter of preference rather than product defect.  I prefer harder surface area to use on round areas of the body or potentially harder like the feet, elbows ect. That being said these should accommodate just about anyone's taste while more importantly being effective."
Cute Cap,"this is a cute shower cap. It comes in a little plastic envelope with a snap making it easy to tuck in a suitcase. The teal pattern is pleasant. The cap itself is unlined and made of rather crinkly plastic. The elastic is covered with white plastic. I've been growing out my hair and it is now past my shoulders. I was pleased that this cap was able to accommodate it all. The plastic is waterproof. the cap should fit most head sizes.

I use shower caps when airbrushing makeup and when actually painting the interior of my house as well as for showers and deep conditioning. This one certainly performs as well as any. the pattern is pretty but it is not especially comfortable or well made. especially considering the price point.  It does the job it was designed to do but the quality is on a par with the dollars store or discount beauty supplier."
Works for Combination Skin Conditions,"Avalon Organics has products that I tend to love because they are so natural and deliciously scented. I have combination skin where I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. This cream is not greasy so it is OK for the oily skin and it is moisturizing so it also soothes the dry skin conditions on my face. I have not found this to be irritating like other Vitamin C creams and serums. In fact this seems to calm my skin significantly so it is not overly sensitive. If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin. I love this and hope it works for you too. Always test a bit on your wrist before applying.

Favorite Perfume,"My favorite perfume ever...
Pretty bottles, and arrived pretty quick.  :)"
DON'T BUY!  TOO WATERY!,"The shampoo has the consistency of water, so you won't be able to hold enough in your hand to get it on your head.  Very disappointed!"
Great product,Great product! No complains.
Perfect,"Works perfect for any type of hair. Dry, greasy or any other. My whole family is happy with results"
Gentle product,Very gentle effect and very nice smell. Recommended.
Great and natural,"Wow, this product really is purely organic and natural! Outstanding vegan ingredient list and no chemical additives. Works perfect, suits my dry hair."
Great,Really great shampoo. It smells good and leaves hair healthy. Amazing to feel that I've finally found a suitable product
I really like that this product is paraben-free,"I really like that this product is paraben-free, but the execution falls flat on its face. The bottle is tiny for the price. Money-to-value ratio is terrible. To add to that, the actual product itself is very thin and feels watered-down. To be fair, that may be the lack of additives, but it leads to over-use of the gel to get adequate coverage and actually feel clean after using it. To top it off, it really doesn't smell very good, either."
Selenium is awesome!,"Got both products from this seller, shampoo and body wash. Both - top notch. 5 stars"

However it didn't do much, maybe my dandruff is a little bit better. It is a thick shampoo and I do like that it bubble good and smells decent. My hair just doesn't feel clean afterwards no matter how much I scrub."
"Outstanding, no complains","Got this shampoo as a solution for my wife's dandruff problem. It worked! She got rid of any dandruff signs after 3-4 uses. As long as she is happy, I am happy too!"

There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.

Five Stars,loved this scent unfortunately can't get it anymore.
Worst shampoo Ive ever used,Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!
Disappointment...,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff."

My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money
Five Stars,"Great gel, it is organic and smell so good, natural!!!"
Five Stars,works great
Scalp-healing,Suffered from itchiness under my hair for couple of years. This product cured the itchiness completely. I took some 4-5 drops of it and then massaged my wet head for a minute approximately. After 2 uses noticed a considerable difference. It definitely gets the job done!
For any type of hair,"Got this product for me and  my daughter. I can say 100% - it works superb on both, long curly and short straight hair."
Great!,"Great body wash for sensitive skin. Definitely works for me. Leaves skin moisturized and clean. Will repurchase for sure.
PS: the candy scent is very pleasant as well."
The best treat for my hair!,Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.
"I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid","I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid.  It smells good but the bottle will be gone in 2 weeks because of how thin it is.  I haven't used much, maybe I can return it."
Four Stars,Good but kind of drying
Great for psoriasis,"My psoriasis has been a lot less irritated now that I am swapping in this shampoo to replace my other shampoo every other wash. Not only is my hair cleaner, but my psoriasis is a lot less flared up. I am very happy with this shampoo."
Five Stars,Really good one my head feels really relaxed after chemical shampoos it's pretty big bottle.thanks for inventor.
Five Stars,The best one Ive ever used!!!
I was super excited to see the 5 star review,"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry."
Five Stars,"Divine smell, cleaning properties and after-use smell! 5/5 stars."
Five Stars,Happy with the product!
Wow,Unexpectedly good. The best smelling shower gel I have ever used. A little bit on the sweet side. But not chemical
Great item,Recommended for anyone interested in getting the best experience from taking a bath or a shower.
Met all my expectations,100% natural and organic and performes much better than chemical counterparts for the same price.
Wonderful product,I am allergic to a lot of things. I occasionally get a red rash over my body after using some other body washes. This one is an exception. Not a single complain. Perfect!
My wife absolutely loves it,"So, 5 stars it is."
Love this shower gel,"Smells great and performs great. Will buy it again, definitely"
Lathers very well,"5-7 drops is enough for the whole body. Very interesting scent. Smells like candies, which is nice."

Awesome quality!,"Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times."
Great product.,"Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders."

It didn't work for my psoriasis,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.
Dont buy,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.
One Star,the smell is bad and totally not natural for me
Not sealed!,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.
Beware,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.
Two Stars,Doesnt smell
One Star,"Throwing it away, burned my scalp."
Good light scent,Good light scent. Have received complements from people that I smell nice after using it. 3 stars because bottle is kind of small for a shower gel (size compariso photo attached) and it doesnt really help me wake up in the morning like other products.
Skip it,"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant."
Meh,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff."
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels ...,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust."
A really good gentle cleanser,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed."
Don't Waste Your Money On This Crap,"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!"
Irritated my scalp on first use,"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews."
Five Stars,Great smell and products.

According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed
Love this product,Love this product. It is the only thing that has worked on my flaky scalp. Not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant in comparison to other products.
Three Stars,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair
Second time buying,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
Really great shampoo for sensitive skin that happens to fix dandruff,"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!"
Two Stars,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.
"Awesome product, no doubt","Awesome product, no doubt ! Use it in the morning before run and my skin doesnt irritate, it already gives it 10 out of 10 ! The smell is great, not chemical which makes more sense to be an organic product but does produce a lot of foam ! Love it !"
Great gift!,Came on time. She will love it!
It smells like artificial bananas,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money."
BETTER THAN RAINBATH,I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon
"Not overpowering, but lasts all day",Love this perfume. Light and feminine and doesn't give me a headache like many other fragrances.
Five Stars,Love this product because of the way it makes my hair feel and look.
Five Stars,Great product for relaxing!

Polytar  Shampoo,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."
Frizz be gone,I love this shampoo!!!!!!
Five Stars,LOVE THIS
This is perfect for guests,I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product
"Cleanest feel, soaps up well and lasts over a month!","I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one."
Good product,Husband loves it.... Uses it to wash his locs
Five Stars,Love this shampoo.  I have been using it for years...keeps the yellow out of gray hair.

Will get more!,Lovin' them.
Five Stars,"Love these, wish they weren't so pricey."
Five Stars,"Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin"
Five Stars,Nice!!
Five Stars,love it. will continue to use all products from herline
Wonderful Fresh Scent,"Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling."
Great exfoliator,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon."
Hate to see it go,"I'm devastated that this fragrance has been discontinued. I would love to see P&G bring it back, even if as an occasional ""anniversary"" run; I'd scoop up extras. As it is, I paid 2 1/2 times per bottle in order to gather as many as the budget would allow. Old Spice Foxcrest, you've served our family well."
I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch,I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.
One of the better body wash smells in my opinion,Smells awesome love it!!
This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection,This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection.  They discontinued it in the store.  I always get compliments of the scent on me. :)
Worth the dollars,My husband loves this soap and I love how it makes him smell. Worth the dollars!
Good products,My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!
Highly recommend!,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!"
Best,Best smell by Old Spice so sad they stopped carrying it at most stores but hey they're loss is the Amazon marketplaces gain. Very quick shipping no issues will be buying again
Five Stars,Excellent product.
Five Stars,thanks
Not Available anymore!!!,This is one of the BEST shampoos for swimmers. I always got complements on my hair since I started using this product. Unavailable now.
Great choice.,Very good fragrance. A good nature smell rather than just a cologne type smell. My favorite of the series.

Highly Recommend,"Took care of my flaky scalp, a problem I've had for years."
Five Stars,Great product..
My hair looks beautiful after just two washes,"This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again.

Five Stars,Love these Songelle products.  All was good.
Awesome product for frizzy hair,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair
Five Stars,always good to freshen up when traveling
Good Product!,"Great smell and good product. I don't know that it moisturizes our daughters hair as much as we'd like, but the Tangle Taming Conditioner is a good follow-up for this shampoo."

My favorite shower gel.,"This is a delicious luxury that I have been enjoying for many years. There is no other aroma like it. Makes me feel like a pasha, and want to break out my safari hat. Thanks to Amazon I no longer have trouble finding it. A dime sized dollop goes a long way, so even the smaller container lasts quite a long time."
and I'm now a happy fox.,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox."
Five Stars,Very good
Nice hair product.,I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.

Five Stars,thank you
Four Stars,It worked very well i disliked nothing
Shampoo,Received product in a timely fashion and am pleased.
Five Stars,I love the scent.
Excellent product!,By far the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have used.  As someone with very thick and dry hair it has given me back the shine and texture I craved.
Really improves the condition of your hair,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
Five Stars,Seems to work as usual.
This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon ...,"This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon anymore, you can only find it online. It is a great product if you are looking for a shine. It did not work well as an anti-frizz product."

Love the scent and it work better than any other ...,"Love  the scent and it work better than any other mousse I have used. it makes my hair look natural, not stiff. My hair is shinier and fuller. Great stuff."
This product makes you love life first thing in the morning.,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day."
Great,Was looking everywhere for this as a gift.  Great scent1
Tan and Beautiful!,I got s beautiful tan with no burning!  The smell was great too.  Thanks Amazon for carying this product; I am definitely going to order this product again.

Wonderful!,I love it! I wish the conditioner was still available
Great for every day use.,It makes your scalp tingle and does a great job of cleaning your hair.
Love it,"Have used this for over a month and I love it! No more itching or burning of my skin. Along with the Olay Age Defying moisturizer, my skin feels smooth and non-greasy. Lovely light scent too."
No more yellow hair,This keeps my silver hair looking silvery (rather than yellow).  I reorder this on a regular basis.

Cooling,I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair
Five Stars,Smells very nice.
Good stuff,"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone."

"Bought for traveling, but will use daily.","I am an avid hair-straightener. I bought this to serve as my travel straightener, and it will actually become my daily user. It is so sleek and nice. The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Five Stars,"I like how it works on my haur, have it looking great."
Five Stars,Amazing product!
Five Stars,Great product great price
Five Stars,Awesome product
Best Ever,I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.
Good for mixed hair,Great shampoo for my 2 year old he has mixed hair
White Rain is an old and trusted shampoo for me,Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.
"Have been using for a decade, will use forever","It was scary when Tigi stopped making this stuff, and we were all scrambling to buy whatever was left online  now I guess they're making it again, so thank god.  They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.  I even gifted some to my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, because he loves using mine so much."
I cannot express enough how much I love this brand,"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo."
Five Stars,What I expected Nice
Our best choice product,"My wife and me have used this shampoo for a long time. Our best choice product.
I have worried my hair loss but this shampoo helpful on my hair."
Four Stars,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.
They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone ...,"Finding a ""natural"" shampoo that isn't disappointing is a challenge. They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down."
Love this product,"Love this product!  It's very nearly good as lanolin products.  It you want to avoid lanolin, it's the way to go!  (P.s.- Their stretch mark cream is awesome)"
Five Stars,as advertised
Four Stars,Still does a great pre shave job.
Voodoo,It really works! This gotta be black magic mixed with voodoo water and chicken cum.
Five Stars,Absolutely Love this
Smells good but.......,I like it and it smells good but the scent doesn't last long at all.
It' Working!,"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion."
Definitely recommended.,"This is a good face wash. First of all, the scent is mild and fresh, but not in a perfumed way -- just clean. I've used it with a washcloth and scrubbed it in, giving my face a really refreshed feel. It easily stripped away excess oil and makeup, but my face did not at all feel dry and tight when I was finished. After using my usual makeup, my face did not show any increase in oiliness and I never developed a dry, flaky skin either. So, I'd have to say if your skin is sensitive, you will get very good results from this product. I certainly did!"
It's not sudsy like a soap,"Clean & Clear sure knows how to make a cleanser feel gentle.  It's not sudsy like a soap.  It's more like a lotion.  The scent was hard to pinpoint, but I'd say it's a bit like cucumber.  This has salicylic acid, folks, the stuff that's in acne treatment.  I should have known, I mean ""Clean & Clear,"" right? My face feels clean afterwards. The one star deduction is for the scent, which I don't think is the greatest."
Same nice scent as the scrub version. Hasn't dried my face after several days,"The scrub version of this has been a regular item in my facial cleaning routine for a few years now. This is the first time that I have used the cream version. Both have the same fresh, invigorating scent.

This feels creamy and is thick. I have been using it with one of those spinning face brushes and that seems to be better than just using my hands or a wash cloth. My skin feels very clean and has not begun to get dry after several days. Because I work with horses outside most days, I can end up cleaning my face several times a day and this is not a bad replacement for the old micro-beads formula."
Washes away oil without irritating skin,"The texture of this face wash reminds me of Noxzema, but it doesn't irritate my skin like Noxzema does. It's a thick creamy wash that doesn't burn or dry out your skin at all. No overwhelming fragrance. There's nothing abrasive in it to exfoliate skin, so it works really well for super sensitive skin. It washes away oil, but is very mild and leaves skin feeling clean but without that tight feeling of a face wash with a lot of medication. Cleans well without irritating."
Lipstick and mascara...,"I do.  I always tell the girls that.  Really, lipstick and mascara!  Nothing else is needed!  So, yes, I had the talk with the teenage girl again.  ""Stop putting the makeup junk all over your face!!!  Your face is beautiful!  Why make it all funny colors?""

She liked the way this one felt when she cleaned (all the gunk off) her face.  She said it didn't feel like it was all burning like one of our recent experiments.  (Don't ask, don't tell.  LOL.)  She said it felt more lotiony.

I hope this one works better at cleaning her face.  I wish she would stop putting stuff all over it."
Cleans very deep until the oil is gone,"I just got out of the shower after using this. The product cleanses well and is very creamy. I used it with my scrub brush to get some exfoliating going too. Even shaved my legs with this product. Can't complain at the moment, except my skin feels dryer. Overall, this was a fine cleanser and if anything, it strips every bit of oil out of your skin. The feeling I am getting is not tingling from squeaky clean, it is more like a bit tight. But it definitely cleaned well. I don't see any eczema or psoriasis and I haven't put any lotions on, as I normally do after I shower. Now I must go apply lotion to my arms and legs and facial products to my face."
Much neater on the counter,"I generally use Crest but the children like Colgate better.  I like that it is a kids' toothpaste so I don't have to stand over them to make them spit out.  It also tastes all right so they don't go kicking and screaming.  Well they do, but not because of the toothpaste.

The best thing about these is that they are standup pumps.  Before these arrived we had about five different toothpaste tubes on the counter.  They were making me grit my teeth."
Makes a difference,"One of the things that we are working on with my grandson is to make sure he takes better care of his teeth.
Part one was a better toothbrush, part two was finding a toothpaste that he really likes and is willing to brush
the full two minutes with.

With this toothpaste he likes the taste and the texture and brushes the full two minutes, encouraged of course by his
Talking Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles toothbrush.
He doesn't like the minty toothpastes that the adults in the house prefer, but adores the fruity bubblegum flavor
of the Colgate Kids Maximum Cavity Protection.

Based on the changes in brushing behavior I have seen, I would recommend both this toothpaste and also
https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-Teenage-Turtles-Talking-Toothbrush/dp/B01613YHQC/ref=cm_rdp_product"
Pump!/No More Cap!,"If you have found the top off the tube of toothpaste like I have, you know this pump is a great idea.  My grandkids sometimes ""forget"" to put the cap back on the toothpaste, so this is perfect.  The pump works great and the kids love it!"
Great for Growing Teeth,"I was relieved to find out the flavor is a mild fruity bubblegum. I once bought a bubblegum flavor toothpaste because it was on sale and the flavor was overpowering. I ended up throwing it away. But this flavor is fine.

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

It also has a good tip on conserving water. I knew that it saves water to turn off the tap when you are brushing but I had no idea that it can save up to 4 gallons of water."
Excellent,"Good stuff. I've always been a fan, and while I'm waaaay past the intended age group I use it anyway. Good taste, cleans he teeth wonderfully, and simply does what it's supposed to."
Good kids' toothpaste,"My kids (5 and 7) really like this toothpaste.  They said it tastes better than the ""adult stuff"" that we usually use.  The pump top is nice b/c it sits firmly on the counter and makes it easier to get some on the brush head without making a big mess like they do with the squeeze tubes.  Overall, very good for the kiddos"
Bubble gum flavor,"This toothpaste is a translucent gel with the sweet flavor and fragrance of old-fashioned bubble gum.  It is green rather than pink, which seems just as odd to me as purple ketchup.

The convenient pump dispenses the correct pea-sized dose that is recommended for brushing.  Children should still be supervised to make sure that they don't swallow the toothpaste to avoid fluoride toxicity.

The plastic container stands upright and holds 4.4 oz. or 124 g.  It has a cap that is easy to remove and replace but which smears any excess toothpaste left on the pump dispenser.  The dispenser opens and closes automatically so that the cap is not needed in routine use.  The safety-sealed containers that I received have an expiration date 16 months from receipt.

Inactive ingredients:  Sorbitol, water, hydrated silica, PEG-12, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, flavor, sodium saccharin, mica, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 1."
My Kids Brush Longer and More Often,"I'm a mom that likes to purchase in volume so this works for me.  The 6 tubes come in a sturdy box so I can take one out and stow the rest in an organized fashion.

Personally, I am not a bubblegum toothpaste enthusiast.  It's way too sweet tasting and too 'dramatic' for me early in the morning.  The kids though love this toothpaste.  Even the teens are more enthusiastic about brushing because of the flavor.

I know some moms don't like fluoride, but our kids have a weak enamel problem and fluoride is a must.

"Convenient pump, mild bubblegum flavor","My eight-year-old daughter, who already has braces, is very picky about her toothpaste. Fortunately she likes the flavor of this Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste. Described as ""mild bubble fruit,"" she just calls it bubblegum. I tried some myself and it is indeed mild. It reminded me of the bubblegum-flavored paste I used as a kid, though I didn't get any fruit flavors. Regardless, it's mild enough that even my picky kid - who hates ""spicy"" paste - liked this.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

It's been years since I've used a pump, and I forgot how much I liked them. This is virtually mess free, with a red button easy enough for my daughter to use in her own. All in all, I was extremely impressed by this toothpaste and might even use it from time to time myself. Recommended."
"it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the","My daughter, a verified kid, won't use adult toothpaste.  She almost refused to use Colgate Kids toothpaste because it looks so much like adult toothpaste.  Hint to the makers: Your design team really needs to step up to the plate.  Throw some color on that tube!

After I convinced her to use the toothpaste, she was quite happy.  Bubblegum (ahem, bubble fruit) isn't her favorite flavor, but she says it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the pump action because it's less mess than traditional tubes.  Yes, the pump and the rocket stand are definite pluses.  No more toothpaste all over the sink.  She still uses the toothpaste without complaint, so it's a thumbs up from her."
Offers Many Benefits For Growing Adult Teeth,"Colgate is my favorite brand of toothpaste.  I and my family always use Optic White.  This review is for Maximum Cavity Protection for growing adult teeth, which is a new concept.  The toothpaste comes in a stand up container that has a press style pump.  You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

The toothpaste tastes good and offers some serious benefits for growing adult teeth.  Perfect for my 19 year old daughter!"
Love the taste!,"This toothpaste tastes fantastic!  It tastes like pink bubblegum, but it's green.  The tube is large, so it will last a long time,  The toothpaste is forced out, so there isn't any squeezing involved.  This makes it nice for kids, because you don't have, half squeezed tubes lying around.  My teeth felt very clean after using this.  I am not a fan of mint, but it is hard to find a toothpaste that isn't mint.  This one tastes great!  I love it!  It makes brushing fun!"
Kids Like the Flavor and the Pump,"My kids love using the Colgate pumps. I think it just seems fun to them and they are easier for kids to operate than having to squeeze tubes. I do feel like the pumps leave a little bit left in the bottom though so you get a little bit less product with them. The pumps are definitely less messy though.

Our order came as 6 pumps of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection in mild bubble fruit flavor. The toothpaste is a blue gel. Its slightly fruity but still minty. All 6 pumps had an expiration date of 10/2017 (this is 8/2016) so the expiration date is over a year out - plenty of time to use all 6 pumps. All the pumps have a safety seal on the pump that has to be broken off so you know they are sealed and safe.

The kids really like this flavor and the pump."
Fragrant Lavender Lotion,"Nice lavender lotion that absorbs easily in my skin. It's not too overpowering scent-wise. The price is fair enough, and this is 10 ounces."
Lavender body lotion:  lightweight moisture; not a fan of this particular lavender scent,"This body lotion is lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly, leaving my skin feeling moisturized but not at all sticky or tacky.  The lavender fragrance is strong at first, but settles into a more subtle scent (though its still very noticeable).  I don't have particularly dry skin, so this is moisturizing enough for me, but if you're looking for a very rich lotion this might be too light for you.

Lavender fragrances vary and I have to say this is not one of my favorites  a bit too perfumey for my taste.  The ingredient list is not impressive, just the typical chemical cocktail you find in most mass market products.  This lotion is just OK  Ill use up the bottle but I doubt Id purchase this in the future."
and the gel lathered nicely and rinsed away without feeling sticky,"This shower gel was decent. The scent was light and not overwhelming, and the gel lathered nicely and rinsed away without feeling sticky. My wife liked the product and commented that it wasn't runny like some of the other pricey gels she's purchased in the past."
"Absorbs quickly, no overpowering scent","Another example of how Amazon throws items together that have nothing to do with each other yet the reviews mix, so it's hard to get an idea of what the review average really means, is it for the lotion, or the water?

THIS review is for the body lotion, which has a slight lavender scent (not too heavy), and is quite creamy.  It goes on evenly and smooth, and absorbs quickly, without any long feeling of greasiness or anything afterwards.  It feels quite nice."
"Very subtle scent, non-resealable bag","I love Pre de Provence soaps, in part because they are powerfully, yet pleasantly fragrant. My bathroom often smells like a spa. Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag. For all of these reasons, but especially the lack of smell, I'm afraid this is one Pre de Provence product I am not able to recommend."
Broken crushed bottle but nice fragrance - light and not overpowering.,"I'm only giving this a neutral rating because it smelled lovely but arrived crushed, leaking and unable to be used. Very nice light fragrance - non irritating which is unusual as I tend to have a lot of allergies. This is not overpowering. Has an almost romantic and nostalgic fragrance."
good natural scent,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it."
Basic shower gel-scores high points for compact packaging and smell,"This is a very basic, gentle shower gel that earns high marks for it's compact, minimal waste packaging and the lovely smell of lavender. I have used a lot of lavender products before and this one is the best. I got this as a freebie, I full intend to buy some when this runs out. I have found my new favorite!"
"Fresh, clean, spicy","This lavender water is very floral and spicy, yet when it is dispersed as spray on our sheets, it is very delicate.  Such a pretty color, too.

It is not a sweet or cloying scent, and is a natural, clean and fresh scent.

Just to test its clarity, I sprayed it on my face.  It just evaporated as I expected it to, leaving no sticky feeling.

I do not have the Pre de Provence spray bottle, just picked up a small 8 ounce spray bottle from the drug store.  Any spray bottle with a very fine mister will do.

This is a plastic bottle."
"Just ""meh"" in my opinion","Smells good but doesn't contain any real lavender essential oil.  I also found it to be drying.  Soon as I dried off I could feel the skin on my legs tightening up.  Now, I use moisturizing creams, butters, lotions or oils everyday but I still don't want to use a drying body wash.  Why stress my skin unnecessarily?  For that reason, I wouldn't buy this again."
Pretty Light Scent,"This has a pretty lavender fragrance. It's not overpowering. Instructions suggest using the linen water in an iron. I don't like to iron, so I put some in a spray bottle and lightly sprayed it on my sheets. There's nothing like lavender to relax you. THis large bottle should last a long time."
Lavender is one of my favorite scents - it even soothes my migraines somewhat,"Lavender is one of my favorite scents - it even soothes my migraines somewhat. This is not too strong, but it does make things smell just a bit nicer and fresher. Not that fake, sickening fragrance of some of the other brands, either."
Smells Good But Doesnt Last,"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

~ Kort"
Touch of Lavender,I love the aroma of lavender and was sure this was going to have a stronger lavender scent.  It did have a faint hint of lavender scent.  That was a disappointment.  The scent lasts all of a hot second once it leaves the bottle.  I discovered that if you pour 2-3 capfuls in your laundry and pour a capful on a washcloth in your bathroom you get the benefit of the lavendar aroma.
"Dull color, not a lot of scent in the dried lavender","I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms."
Lavender blossoms: smell amazing and bag will last for a long time,"Dried Lavender Blossoms? Amazing! If I had known that you could buy these, I would have purchased them a long time ago. We love the smell of lavender in our house. It is probably the top scent that we buy in all candles, waxes, etc. My original plan was to use this like potpourri. When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible. I like to use them in my sock and underwear drawers.

These lavender blossoms are high quality and will last for a long time. I highly recommend them if you want your house to smell like lavender."
Smells Amazing,"This lavendar water smells amazing. I put it in a spray bottle to spritz my bed linens to freshen them up a bit. I do wish it came with a spray top, although then it wouldn't look as nice, but it would be more functional, at least for my uses. I'm really happy with this product. Smells great. No allergy issues."
Mostly water.,Barely any scent. And it doesn't smell like a lavender. I don't like it.
Wonderful lavender scent,"I am a bath person.  I always have been.  I love floral bath salts (not the kind that get you in trouble), and this fits the bill perfectly.  The lavender scent is light and refreshing, surrounding you with a pleasing aroma.  The salts dissolve completely, not leaving gritty residue behind."
wonderul light French Lavender blossom spray,"I can remember watching my grandma iron clothes. She used a lavender scented spray, and sometimes starch. The clothes also usually smelled of the fresh outside as we hung our clothes on a line. She would let me spray and iron the hankies and pillow cases. To this day the scent of lavender brings back such happy memories.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

also very nice spritzed lightly on the bed a half hour or so before going to bed leaves a clean, lavender sleep experience.

Truly something I'll be buying once this bottle is gone, although given how little it takes the bottle will last a while."
"Too weak, scent dissipates too fast","Lavender water.

This has a nice scent and the sprayer sprays well, but it is so weak that the scent disappears within a few minutes If I spray more, the sheets get damp. I received a free bottle in exchange for an honest review and I was pretty excited about having lavender-scented sheets, but I won't be buying any of this item and can't recommend it. I have tried this company's soaps, though, and they are wonderful!"
Dried lavender blossoms,"These lavender blossoms are similar to those that local lavender farms sell in our nearby green market.  It comes out a little more expensive than when purchased from the growers, but it is just as fragrant and reasonably priced."
Clear Gel Creates Nice Lather With Delicate Lavender Scent,"Lavender is my favorite soap fragrance, so it's no surprise that I love this PRE DE PROVENCE FRENCH LAVENDER BATH & SHOWER GEL.  For the shower, a pump or two is enough for a nice lather, and the lather washes off easily.

The lavender fragrance is delicate, and it lingers for only a short time.  It doesn't overwhelm perfume, aftershave lotion, shampoo, or other scented products you may like to use.  The clear gel arrives in an attractive square pump dispenser.

The shower gel leaves my skin silky smooth, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin."
Leaves a nice clean scent,I'm personally not a huge fan of lavender scents but this one isn't bad. My wife uses it to freshen up our guest rooms when we have visitors and it's not overpowering. It actually leaves a nice subtle scent and reinforces that the place is clean. She's used it in the dryer to de-wrinkle blouses just before going out.
Theis review is for Pre de Provence lavender bath salts,"These bath salts do smell like real lavender, and turn bathing into a luxurious experience.  They would make a nice but inexpensive holiday gift."
nice scent,"This has a very nice scent and works well in your drawers, but you do have to put them in a mesh bag b/c they are small and can get messy.  The scent lasts a long time.  Overall, very nice for my clothing drawers."
"LOVE the lavender, rich indulgence","Beautiful lavender crystals that smell heavenly.  Bath salts dissolve quickly in hot water turning the bath water the palest shade of lavender.  Such a lovely indulgence for your everyday bath.  I love having little rituals like this one that makes me feel like a super wealthy spa girl :-)  I have some of the Pre De Provence soaps and it is an amazing way to step out of regular, messy, hard life for a few minutes.  Yep, a low cost escape until I can go to the fields of France and see the lavender for myself."
Potpourri material,"I'm reviewing the dried lavender blossoms. The scent is wonderful, so long as you like the scent of lavender -- and I do. I mix this with some dried flower petals and use it as potpourri in the restroom. It's not an immediately overwhelming scent, but when you walk into the room, it smells very nice. In the fall, I'm going to mix it with some ground cloves.

I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not overpriced, but it's not a steal, either. Overall, though, I'm happy with it."
Heavenly fragrance,"Who doesn't love the fragrance of lavender?  This is a large cellophane bag of the dried blooms, which look a bit like brown rice.  The fragrance is strong, even before opening the bag.  Little bowls of this placed around the house provide a lovely fresh atmosphere without being overpowering.  The 5.3 ounces is about two cups.

If you're looking for dried flower blooms for scented decorations, this isn't your product.  It's not pretty, but it does smell wonderful.  I'm waiting for someone to ask why I have a dish of rice on my coffee table!"
Imparts lovely scent,"I never considered a scented water for ironing or steaming my clothes until I saw this product.  What a great idea!  I added this to my garment steamer as well as my steam iron and both impart a lively French Lavender scent that remains long enough to get noticed.  My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Overall - this is a nice product which lends a nice fragrance to my clothing.  I would recommend it."
So Fresh and Inviting!,"What a fabulous way to spread the clean, inviting fragrance of Lavender throughout your home. I have never tried a product like this before, but now I know it is an absolute must-have. It has so many uses. You can definitely use it on clean linens, but I also use it to freshen things like the bathroom rug and the shower curtain between washings. You can use this delightful spray on pretty much anything you can spray water on. It's great sprayed in drawers and in closets, too. The smell is so light and fresh, I even caught my granddaughter using it to slightly dampen her hair before using the curling iron! What a smart girl. I absolutely adore the Pre De Provence product line. Everyone of them is made with high quality and wonderful scents. This Lavender Blossom Water is no exception. It's a nice way to bring a touch of Provence into your own home."
Very Pungent Lavender Bath Salts - Great For Relaxing After a Long Day,"I am reviewing the Bath Salts.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender bath salts come in a plastic 19 ounce container with a screw lid.  There is no protective seal on the product bottle.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

The only reason I subtracted a star is because I had to give my tub an extra rinse after taking my Lavender incensed bath with these salts."
Great Product,"Great product, I had no issues and love the way it smelled and how it made my skin feel."
DON'T BUY!  TOO WATERY!,"The shampoo has the consistency of water, so you won't be able to hold enough in your hand to get it on your head.  Very disappointed!"

However it didn't do much, maybe my dandruff is a little bit better. It is a thick shampoo and I do like that it bubble good and smells decent. My hair just doesn't feel clean afterwards no matter how much I scrub."
"Outstanding, no complains","Got this shampoo as a solution for my wife's dandruff problem. It worked! She got rid of any dandruff signs after 3-4 uses. As long as she is happy, I am happy too!"

Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am ...,Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.
"Dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. ...","It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings"
Five Stars,Outstanding! Top organic shampoo!
I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away."
Five Stars,10 stars right here. This product helped me with my itchy skin and my sister's greasy hair complain.
First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. ...,First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. Worth it for sure. No more struggle with getting rid of my dandruff problem. I use it about once per 2-3 days and it is more than enough to keep my hair and head skin healthy.
One Star,Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin
Worst shampoo Ive ever used,Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!
Disappointment...,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff."
... because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the ...,I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money
Five Stars,works great
Scalp-healing,Suffered from itchiness under my hair for couple of years. This product cured the itchiness completely. I took some 4-5 drops of it and then massaged my wet head for a minute approximately. After 2 uses noticed a considerable difference. It definitely gets the job done!
For any type of hair,"Got this product for me and  my daughter. I can say 100% - it works superb on both, long curly and short straight hair."
The best treat for my hair!,Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.
Four Stars,Good but kind of drying
Great for psoriasis,"My psoriasis has been a lot less irritated now that I am swapping in this shampoo to replace my other shampoo every other wash. Not only is my hair cleaner, but my psoriasis is a lot less flared up. I am very happy with this shampoo."
Five Stars,Really good one my head feels really relaxed after chemical shampoos it's pretty big bottle.thanks for inventor.
Five Stars,The best one Ive ever used!!!
I was super excited to see the 5 star review,"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry."
Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works,I have a dry scalp and occasional dandruff. This product really helps! Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works.
Awesome quality!,"Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times."
Great product.,"Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders."
"The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water","This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false "
but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and ...,"It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use."
It didn't work for my psoriasis,I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.
Dont buy,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.
Beware,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.
Two Stars,Doesnt smell
One Star,"Throwing it away, burned my scalp."
Skip it,"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant."
Meh,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff."
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels ...,"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust."
A really good gentle cleanser,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed."
Don't Waste Your Money On This Crap,"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!"
Irritated my scalp on first use,"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews."
Five Stars,Great smell and products.
Love this product,Love this product. It is the only thing that has worked on my flaky scalp. Not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant in comparison to other products.
Three Stars,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair
Second time buying,"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
Really great shampoo for sensitive skin that happens to fix dandruff,"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!"
Two Stars,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.
Great gift!,Came on time. She will love it!
It smells like artificial bananas,"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money."
BETTER THAN RAINBATH,I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon
"Not overpowering, but lasts all day",Love this perfume. Light and feminine and doesn't give me a headache like many other fragrances.
Five Stars,Love this product because of the way it makes my hair feel and look.
Polytar  Shampoo,"I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis.
But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real."
Frizz be gone,I love this shampoo!!!!!!

Five Stars,love this shampoo
Five Stars,"Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin"
Five Stars,love it. will continue to use all products from herline
Great exfoliator,"Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon."
I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch,I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.
Worth the dollars,My husband loves this soap and I love how it makes him smell. Worth the dollars!
Good products,My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!
Highly recommend!,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!"

My hair looks beautiful after just two washes,"This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again. The smell is not great, but you'll look past it to save your scalp. It is one of the only products that is 100% truly organic. No added chemicals. Very gentle and effective. I highly recommend this product."
Good hair product for dry coarse hair,Have been using the product since I got my first as a gift and I like it.  I have dry coarse hair and it helps to soften it and take away the dullness.

Beautiful and Unusual Hair Decor,"Looks very well-made and colors are rich.  A bit larger than I expected (shame on me for not looking at dimensions), but I think it will look lovely in my daughter's hair."
Awesome product for frizzy hair,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair
Five Stars,always good to freshen up when traveling
Good Product!,"Great smell and good product. I don't know that it moisturizes our daughters hair as much as we'd like, but the Tangle Taming Conditioner is a good follow-up for this shampoo."

Really improves the condition of your hair,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."

"Bought for traveling, but will use daily.","I am an avid hair-straightener. I bought this to serve as my travel straightener, and it will actually become my daily user. It is so sleek and nice. The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."
Four Stars,"good, happy with the product and price"
Best product for dry or aging hair.,Would not use any other conditioner.  I use it at least every 2 weeks to keep my white hair shining and healthy!
keeps my white hair from looking yellow.,"The silver shampoo I had been using is no longer available, so I tried this. It does a great job as far as color goes but didn't leave my hair as soft. I have very thick coarse hair and it's hard to find a product to soften it. Overall I'm very pleased, especially for the cost."

Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable,"Purchased this product after researching products to help my son with his three year old daughters naturally curly blonde hair. The baby shampoos he had used were drying her hair out, and most of the detanglers weighted down her curls too much. Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable, not dried out, and has the natural bouncy curls that are adorable."

White Rain is an old and trusted shampoo for me,Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.
"Have been using for a decade, will use forever","It was scary when Tigi stopped making this stuff, and we were all scrambling to buy whatever was left online  now I guess they're making it again, so thank god.  They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.  I even gifted some to my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, because he loves using mine so much."
I cannot express enough how much I love this brand,"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo."
Our best choice product,"My wife and me have used this shampoo for a long time. Our best choice product.
I have worried my hair loss but this shampoo helpful on my hair."
Four Stars,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.
They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone ...,"Finding a ""natural"" shampoo that isn't disappointing is a challenge. They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down."
Falling apart already,This is really thin and really cheap. Mine started coming apart after a couple scrubs.
Easy to use and was painless,"This bamboo foot file is an improvement over the old style pumice stone.  The skin on the heels of my feet gets dry and cracked, so I am constantly moisturizing, etc.  I tried this foot file after soaking my feet in warm water and it painlessly helped remove a lot of dead skin.  It was easy to clean and  hang to dry as well.  I had used the old style pumice stones in the past but found them a bit too harsh and painful.  This file is an improvement."
Taking care of your skin,"As is the case with anyone that has a drop of Nordic blood in them, I'm a huge believer in the benefits of dry brushing your skin for health.
If you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.
Next, I like to get in the shower and use the brush while it's wet to both cleanse and to use the bumpy side to massage my legs and rear.
Afterwards, a good quality moisturizer or oil and you're all set."
which is super soft. It holds all my body wash,"I haven't used this mitt to hold my small soaps, but I have used it with body wash.  The jute side doesn't feel so rough when it's dry, but don't let that fool you.  It can really scrub!  And boy, are there areas of my body that need it.  The other side is bamboo fiber, which is super soft.  It holds all my body wash, maybe too well because I'm not getting quite the number of suds that I expect.  However, I do like this mitt because it scrubs me cleaner than I've felt for a long time.  Dead skin cells be gone!"
"Holds soap well, but one side really scratches","I usually only use liquid body soap, partly because it's a pain when I drop bar soaps, and unless I have a washcloth the lather isn't as nice. When I saw this exfoliator that firmly holds the soap in place (with Velcro no less), I decided to give it a try.

The holder is a good size and even fits a thick bar of soap. The Velcro closure works very well to firmly keep the soap inside the sleeve. The soft washing side provides a nice bubbly lather. The exfoliating side, however, if pretty rough, even using a soft touch. I really can't use it as it hurts to the point of leaving scratches on my skin. But the most concerning part about this soap envelope, however, is that it doesn't dry between showers, and that doesn't seem sanitary.  On the one hand, it can be washed, but on the other I hate to think of the bacteria forming due to moisture between washes. Even 24 hours after my last shower, it's still wet (not merely damp). All in all, this is handy for those who prefer bar soap, but it's not good enough to make me switch full time from liquid body wash."
Natural Exfoliator,"<div id=""video-block-R12A38WH9VDSUO"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/911K4Ym33zS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TFyFHwggS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;If you want a natural fiber bath mitt for the at-home spa experience, this offering from Urban Spa is a good choice. The bamboo side is just rough enough to exfoliate without feeling like you are scouring your skin, and the jute side is soft and has a ""polishing"" effect. Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife. I also worry that over time it might get a musty smell since it takes a while to dry, but as long as I keep using it with soap, I hope that it won't be an issue.

"Not for Cellulite, But Great for Exfoliating!","Obviously, cellulite is not affected by a brush. Simple biology reveals the massive flaws in this idea. If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

Overall, while one doesn't want to by this for the purposes of reducing cellulite (that's not how it works), it is phenomenal for exfoliating!"
Nice size; good combination of soft and scrubby textures,"I'm very pleased with this mitt. It is large enough to comfortably fit my hand, but not so large that I feel it was designed to wash a car. The soft side feels like it is made of microfiber, and is quite cushy and mild on my skin. The rough side is composed of fabric loops that are rough enough to get some serious scrubbing done, but not as rough as some loofah mitts I've used that feel rather uncomfortable (or even downright painful).

It's put together well with no loose seams, and has a small but usable loop so you can hang it up for proper drying.  All in all, an excellent mitt."
"A good, two-sided bath brush","This is . . . a bath brush!  With nice thick bristles on one side, and rounded plastic knobs on the other side. Both are suitable for cleaning your back and any other area that is hard to reach, though I prefer the bristle side. As for reducing cellulite . . . not really."
"works very well, maybe not the best for sensitive skin","I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results."
My surgeon recommended it.,"I recently had major surgery, and my surgeon recommended using Aquaphor to moisturize my scars and help in the healing process. So far it seems to be helping. I've been using Aquaphor everyday, and my doctors tell me that my scars are healing very well. Aquaphor also costs a fraction of what some exotic scar creams cost. So far, so good."
It Really Works,"This goop is amazing. You know it's hardcore because it's not laced with flowers or made to look pretty-this is 'healing ointment' as it states clearly. A big old swap on your finger and it will heal just about anything minor-scrapes, etc. It does look greasy on, so best to put on if you're in the house. You'll definitely want to be able to wash your hands after or wipe them off after applying."
"Fantastic product, at a fantastic price!","I have eczema that can be severe at times, during a breakout. My doctor recommended Aquaphor Healing Ointment, and he did me quite a favor. This cuts the outbreak time in half. My feet get it the worst.

I used to use Neosporin to heal any splits and cracks I've had on my feet and hands. Aquaphor  works better than Neosporin at a fraction of the price. The ointment feels very soothing and not greasy at all. I mistakenly thought that since it looks like Vaseline, that it would be similar in feel, but it's not at all. Aquaphor is much better. It's a wonderful product."
Five Stars,"Smells amazing and does a good job of refreshing. Provides some moisturization, and freshens the skin up."
Be careful if you have sensitive skin!,"UPDATE ON 8-28-17:  Since I first purchased this, I've been getting really bad skin rashes and welts on my face after using this.  I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.  One or more of the ingredients is definitely too strong if you have bad reactions!
-------

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine."""
This is scientology of personal hygiene equipments. Everyone outside ...,"This is scientology of personal hygiene equipments. Everyone outside looks at it as a crazy contraption, but every owner is LOVING it!"
definitely good for sensitive skin but basically just a facial moisturizer,"This may be suitable for some people but it is not really what I need in an eye cream.

Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off:

Water, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, dimethicone, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, tocopherol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, lavender flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, grape seed oil, bisabolol, jojoba seed oil, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, PEG/PPG-4/12 dimethicone, silica, xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, aminomethyl propanol.

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

But, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area."
really does last quite a long time,"I have this in ""Berry Seductive"" but I've had a great experience with it and would certainly purchase it in other colors.

As you can see from the product image, this comes with two products -- a lip stain and a balm -- in one container.  I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.

I gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

I did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.

The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.

Overall, I'm very happy with this product.  Definitely glad I bought it."

Great soap,This soap not only smells delightful--if a little girly (sorry gentleman) but probably one of my favorite soaps I don't buy from the local crafters. It really and properly freshens the skin and can be used all over the body.
smells great,"This soap has a nice fresh mint scent that isn't overwhelming. Because it's triple milled it doesn't leave a melted puddle every time I use it.

This soap produces a great lather and feels great on my skin."
Wild for Wildflower,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this pink bar and the scent of Wildflower - but it's perfection. I would classify the wildflower scent as a fruity floral, it's light, pretty and sweet. (And, this does not have even a hint of rose or gardenia which is a typical floral go to note!)
I can smell a hint of it in the bathroom, but very faint and soft, and not at all on my skin after showering.
The bar itself is large, and it took a little extra grip from the usual bath size bars I use. But, the formula is creamy and smooth, lathers nicely and doesn't leave my skin dry. I can't say it's the most moisturizing of bars, but it feels really nice and rinses completely.
I love this scent so much more than I thought I would, that this is my new go to bar of soap."
Just didn't do it for us,"Ours arrived oddly shaped with a long line dividing the top surface, like a crater.  It must have been stored somewhere with enough heat to let it be disfigured like that without breaking, cracking, or flaking bits off.

Scent is just OK, and while we don't like ""loud"" fragrances, and appreciate subtle scents for things like soaps and body washes, this was just TOO subtle.  But then again, that could've been a side effect from however it was stored for a while that left it disfigured...

So for us, there was nothing special here.  It soaped fine, lathered fine, didn't dry out skin, but so to many, many other products out there that cost considerably less than this per bar."
Nice fragrance,This soap has a very nice fragrance. It is not too strong or perfumy. The bar of soap itself is very large. It lathers up well and rinsed cleanly. A great bar of soap to use in the guest bathroom. It will impress your guests!
Five Stars,love

Luxury soap thats long lasting,Theres nothing like using a luxurious so like this in the shower or bath. It has a lovely scent and lathers up nicely. But the thing I like best about it is that its the French milled or hard miilled soap and it lasts a long time. I think of soaps like this as one of lifes little luxuries. I think they're worth the extra money since they last so much longer than grocery store soaps.
Olive Oil = lovely masculine soap,"The Pre De Provence Shea butter is a wonderful bar soap for any bathroom or kitchen. The  ""Olive Oil"" scent was simple and slightly masculine, and the color is a beautiful warm sage. The soap lasts a long time as a hand soap by our sink (months of daily use and it's still going strong). It doesn't dry out my hands either, and I wash a lot.

If I ordered another bar of this, I don't know what I'd choose since they have such an amazing assortment. But I do recommend Olive Oil for an understated and beautiful soap."
Scent is barely detectable.,The jasmine scent is barely detectable. I am returning this item.
Great for those sensitive to fragrance,"This soap is great for those who are sensitive to fragrance.
I'm not sure it is UN scented, but it is certainly LIGHTLY scented.
Five stars."
Lovely.,"Light, feminine, clean not overpowering scent. Very relaxing fragrance, won't compete with other scents, but will stay with you for a little while.  Just lovely.  The soap itself, like any I have tried from this brand, is finely milled and pleasant and luxurious feeling, rinses cleanly.

Really elevates cleansing to a sensory experience."
"Beautiful, Rich and Moisturizing",This is beautiful soap with a gentle but rich scent. It is soft and easy to rinse but leaves your skin feeling wonderful and soft. It's a huge bar and lasts a long time.
"Clean scent, makes my skin feel good","I've been using Pre de Provence soaps for probably a decade, but have only used the more traditional scents. I've enjoyed trying some of the more recent additions to their line-up. The Sea Salt variety is new to me, and I really like it. It does smell salty, but in a good way. It makes my skin feel very clean when I shower with it. The scent is refreshing, although it doesn't linger on the skin. It doesn't dry my skin out, it just makes it feel clean. This is a soap I would gladly buy in the future."
Very exfoliating but can be a little rough,"Love the scent of this very large bar.  It lathers well too but the dried botanicals can be too rough for sensitive skin.  When I lathered up with just bar in hand, I found it uncomfortably scratchy on my lower legs near my shins where there's not much fat or muscle.  When I used a wash cloth, nylon shower puff or a nylon soap bag I didn't notice any irritation.  So, for my sensitive skin, I would probably skip this bar."
"The fragrance is mild, the bar is hard and ...","The fragrance is mild, the bar is hard and lasts a long time, and the soap is mild and softens the skin. Altogether a pleasant soap to use."
Amazing Soap,"This soap is great. It foams up and is so nice and milky feeling on the skin. It smells really good, but you definitely have to like the scent of Sandalwood to enjoy it."
"Sea Salt:  A citrus-y, spicey fragrance","At 5.2 ounces, this is a substantial bar of soap!  Its hard to describe the fragrance; Im inclined to say that it smells like Mens cologne  a blend of citrus and spice.  While the fragrance is strong when you lather up, it leaves only a hint of scent once youve rinsed off.  This soap lathers well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  Its non-drying and doesnt irritate my skin; there are also no rough exfoliating bits like some of the other Pre de Provence soaps have.  This soap does not dissolve like Alka-Seltzer  it lasts much longer than your average drugstore brand soap.

Bottom Line:  Rich lather, non-drying, gender-neutral fragrance"
I know sandalwood is a more manly scent; but ...,"I know sandalwood is a more manly scent; but even though I'm not sure wood is what I want my man to wear, it is the best-smelling wood I I've ever smelled in a soap.  Women can wear it, too, by the way.  Although I have to say, this bar is big, so make sure you have hands big enough to wrap around it."
Another terrific french milled soap,The Pre de Provence line of french milled soaps are all delightful. This one has a mild patchouli scent. Whether that is your favorite scent or not is a matter of personal preference.
A nice quality soap,"I was a little disappointed in this soap because it just didn't have a strong enough Patchouli scent.
If you like to keep scented soaps in your lingerie drawer for a short time before using them to wash with, take this soap and go straight to the shower or bath.
That old fashioned way of scenting your clothes won't work with this one.
You will, however, really appreciate it in terms of cleaning your skin without stripping down all of the natural oils that keep us nice and soft. Patchouli is also a terrific scent for any gender. Even though the fragrance is not strong, a light Patchouli does come across while you're bathing.
The generously-sized bar lasts a nice long time."
"I hoped for a more potent patchouli scent, unfortunately it's not there.  But my skin loves this soap!","I have another brand of bar soap with a much more potent patchouli fragrance.  I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

If you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patchouli-100-Pure-amp-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B000146LKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  Maybe you might be interested in an Italian bar soap put out by Pre de Provence.

It has a lovely, intriguing and subtle fragrance.

A word on the size of this bar:  I have long fingers, so this large 250g size is not awkward in my hand.  But I can easily see that it might be a problem for smaller hands.  There is patchouli in the 200g size, but not the 150g.

"With this soap, you give up the true intense sandalwood fragrance, but gain softer, smoother skin","I love Pre de Provence bar soaps, and I love sandalwood.  By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sandalwood-100-Pure-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B00112DRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

A word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.  If you have small hands, you might be better off with the 200g bar,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Shea-Butter-Enriched-Artisanal-French-Soap-Bar-200-g-Traditional-Fragrance-Sandalwood/dp/B001UFZOMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Sandalwood</a>, or the soap on a rope,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Soap-On-a-Rope-Sandalwood-200-Gram/dp/B074QWY7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Soap On a Rope, Sandalwood, 200 Gram</a>.

It is a wonderful fragrance!"
Soft but not greasy,Nice big bar of smelly soap. It is quite fragrant so you had better like the sandalwood smell. Leaves your skin soft without feeling greasy. It laters nicely and rinses off really well. It's a large bar.
Luxurious French Soap With Musky Masculine Fragrance,"This PRE DE PROVENCE PATCHOULI SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED SOAP (250 Gram) has the mild, musky fragrance that many women find sexy, but the fragrance is risky.  To some people (including me) it smells like fungus or damp basement.  Still, this soap may appeal to male household members, because it's so different from most other Pre de Provence soaps (with their fairly strong, flowery fragrances).

This is a large bar of luxurious French soap.  It lathers beautifully, and the fragrance never lingers too long.  The soap is very gentle, and doesn't irritate sensitive skin.

For men, a much safer Pre de Provence soap is the Sandalwood bar (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Sandalwood/dp/B01LWWOLW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Sandalwood</a>)."
"Luxurious French Soap With Mild, Masculine Fragrance","This PRE DE PROVENCE Sandalwood SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED SOAP (250 Gram) should appeal to the male members of the household, because of the mild, woody fragrance.  (Most Pre de Provence soaps have fairly strong, flowery fragrances.)

It's a large bar of luxurious French soap.  It lathers beautifully, and the fragrance never lingers too long.  The soap is very gentle, and doesn't irritate sensitive skin."
"Bracing, briny, so fresh, with a bit of lime.  Kind of like 7Up with all its bubbly effervescence","Picture yourself on an outcropping of rocks at the ocean's edge; brisk, breezy day, not humid.  Pop open a bottle of 7Up and pour into your iced glass.  Don't quite bury your nose in the bubbles, but let the effervescence tickle and tingle you nose.  Take a sip.  Feel the ocean spray, breath in the salty brine.  Okay, you got it:  That is the fragrance of the Pre de Provence Sea Salt bar soap.

It is brisk and bracing.  It is not sweetish, but just a touch sweet.  It is citrus-y and lime-y.  If the effervescence had a smell, this would be it.  (Do NOT dare think fish--think fresh, and of the sea.  It also has some ginger in it.  Not the warming gingerbread fragrance, but the bright and zingy scent of just chopped, fresh ginger root.

The soap makes creamy, bright white, rich luscious lather.  It leaves my skin soft.

I can't get enough of it.  And I want Pre de Provence to make more products in this particular fragrance, so I can have it all day long."
Very pleasing,"Excellent. Milled soap is something I grew up with and still enjoy immensely. The price might initially seem high but these bars of soap last much longer than average non milled soap. Additionally, these are non irritating thanks to what it does NOT contain - no paraben or other harsh toxic chemicals. No animal testing is a must. This fragrance is light and won't overwhelm or linger - leaves skin feeling clean yet smooth -not sticky or with any type of film. I'd rate this as a slightly more earthy or masculine type fragrance - less floral. Very pleasing."
Too heavily scented for me,"I like most of the soaps in this line, but this one had such an overpowering scent when I opened the package that it made my eyes hurt. I don't know if that was something weird about our sample or if it is true of all of them.

If you don't like heavily scented soaps, avoid the Sandalwood Shea Butter version."
Definitely lathers nicely and doesn't dry my hands,"This was a definite unexpected surprise. I got this and gave it to my wife, but after she raved about it, I tried it. Definitely lathers nicely and doesn't dry my hands. Also, it was a nice sized bar, not too small like some of her other fancy soaps she buys."
Shea Butter Overpowers Sandalwood,"I really like this soap, but I have to say that Shea Butter scent dominates and mutes the sandalwood scent. I love a strong, earthy sandalwood, but this is not that. It is more of a soapy perfume with a hint of sandalwood. That aside, the large bar lathers up richly and when it is finally rinsed off, it leaves me feeling refreshed and clean. It doesn't irritate my skin, but like other Pre de Provence soaps, it cleans so well that it can leave it feeling a little dry. I would definitely get it again, but just wish it smelled more strongly of sandalwood.

~ Kort"
Simple luxury,"This is a huge bar of great, thick, luxurious soap, in a classic form and scent.  The constant cheapening of hotel soaps has almost had me forgetting what a real soap was like and why it is a forgotten pleasure.  I like it!"
Luxurious French Soap Has Fresh Sea Breeze Fragrance,"I love Pre de Provence soaps, but was intensely curious about the Sea Salt bar.  What would it smell like?  Why would I want to wash my hands with sea salt?  Happily, this PRE DE PROVENCE SEA SALT FRENCH SOAP BAR (150g, 5.2 Ounce) is no different from the other Pre de Provence soaps--it smells wonderful, and produces a rich, thick lather.

The fragrance is hard to describe.  Its kind of floral, but maybe is best described as fresh sea breeze.  It makes one think of fresh air and sunshine.  The fragrance doesn't linger overlong.  The soap doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, but may be a little more drying than other Pre de Provence soaps (unless it's my imagination working overtime).

The soap definitely contains salt. The ingredients are:  sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate, water, fragrance, palm acid, titanium dioxide, glycerin, palm kernel acid, SODIUM CHLORIDE, shea butter, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium edta, tetrasodium etidronate, benzyl salicylate, linalool, geraniol, citral."
Patchoule brings out my Inner Hippie,I consider a shea butter soap a guilty pleasure.  When you're used to purchasing soap in 8-bar bricks at Costco for a bottom-line price  having a huge bar of gentle sudzing Girley soap in your tub is a luxury. Im also enough of a 60s hippy that I have a soft spot for Patchoule.  This soap is gentle to the skin and leaves you feeling soft and subtle.  I LOVE this product.
"The Smell of Musk, Peace, and Love","If you love the scent of Patchouli plants and oils, you will love this soap!  This is a huge bar of soap.  It measures 4 inches wide and is 2.5 inches high and over an inch thick.  It is a light cocoa color with engravings on both sides of the bar.  The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.

To me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of ""Dead Heads,"" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

This soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

While women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.

This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  It makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.  Heaven probably smells a little like Patchouli and the scent is captured in this bar of soap.  It's fantastic."
Dried My Skin Out,"This is the fourth Pre de Provence soap I tried, I loved the others but this one dried my skin out. After using my skin felt tight and itchy and to calm it I had to use a total body lotion after the shower. This soap arrived in a clear plastic wrap with no labeling at all without an ingredient list. The scent to me is of citrus and I suspect the natural oils of the citrus fruits in the fragrance are what is oil-stripping my skin and leaving me with dried out skin. Ratings 2 stars = Don't Like It. I cannot comment on anything else about the ingredients since I have no ingredient list and there is not one on the product page either."
Nice scent.,"Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar is a good sized, long lasting soap bar that smells nice. The bar doesn't seem to provide the ""rich creamy lather"" is promises, but it's not a big deal. It provides enough to get the job done. The flowery citrus scent is moderate, and not overpowering. I'm surprised at how long he bar is lasting. While I don't find anything exceptional about this soap, I like it."
"lasts longer than mass-mproduced consumer soaps, natural scent","This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent."
Natural fragrances,"Pr de Provence is known for the large blocks of savon de Marseille made with olive oil that are especially suited for use in the kitchen, but these newer artisanal bars are easier to handle.  They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.  The milk, coconut, and green tea are more subdued fragrances and are a good choice for people who don't like strong fragrances.  They are all made with mostly natural ingredients, and some even have visible bits of almond, pomegranate, sage, etc."
"The sage is a fresh, clean fragrance","This is a high quality soap that produces a nice rich lather.  The Sage has little grainy bits that provide mild exfoliation and the clean, fresh fragrance is gender neutral (not at all perfumey).

I don't use soap to cleanse my face, but as a body cleanser this is non-drying and non-irritating.  Because this soap is made from higher quality ingredients it lasts considerably longer than the average drugstore brand.  It is a little bit of a splurge, but Id call it an affordable luxury.  Recommended."
"Lovely scent, not heavy at all.","This is one of the first Pre de Provence soaps I've tried, and I was able to try many!  The Gardenia scent is light, not heavy. The white bar doesn't leave any residue around the tub or shower walls.

The feel is what is amazing: I grew up with Zest and Dial.  This is far softer and more intensely packed...it has lasted so far much longer than what I am used to.  A Dial bar lasts about a week at our house with two boys. This is harder and doesn't turn to mush.  I see that as a benefit just as it will last longer. I did try those pricey Fresh bars from Sephora.  They too had this nice feature of being long-lasting, but their price is 5 times the price of these."
My wife absolutely loves it,My wife loves it. It leaves a nice but not overt scent and she says it leaves her skin softer. She's a big fan of the soap.
Terrific soap,"French milled soap is the best, and this is a great example. Very lightly scented. Cleans skin well without being harsh."
"Big, Maybe Too Big","Oh my, this is one of the soaps I new arrived the moment I opened my mailbox because I could smell it already.  Then I took it out of the package, put it in my soap holder in my bathroom and when I went to bed at night, I could smell it just walking up my stairs.  The strength of the smell did die down after a couple days.  And about putting it in my soap holder, this bar is so big it barely even fit, much bigger than your standard bar for better or worse.  Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.  But more importantly it does leave me feeling clean without drying my skin and that is really all you can ask of your soap."
Not too fruity,"I usually don't like fruity or food scented body products. I don't want to smell like birthday cake or strawberries etc. I decided to give this one a try though and am happy with it. It has a soft floral scent on top of the pomegranate and it smells really good. More feminine than fruity. The little bits in it act like a soft body scrub, so you can use the bar directly on your skin and it lathers up nicely and gives some exfoliation benefits, too. The latter is more of a nice milky/creamy lather and doesn't dry out my skin. It doesn't feel like there's a soap film left behind on me and my skin doesn't feel tight. I don't think the scent lasts on my skin and that's ok with me."
Moisturizing Soap,"Soap which is fragrant and moisture rich. The end product is soft, moist skin. the Pre de Provence soaps are wonderful, regardless of scent. They eliminate itchy dry skin and make bath time something to look forward too."
Violette Fragrance is Awesome,"This review is for the 150 g bar of Pre de Provence She Butter Soap with the Violette fragrance.  I absolutely love this scent, and the soap leaves my skin feeling great. I like the size of this bar better than the larger bar, which is too big for my small hands."
Favorite facial soap,Giant bar of French quad milled shea butter soap - milled once more than traditional soaps from Provence.  This is my favorite soap for my face.  It is amazing.  I use it with my Clarisonic and these bars from France last forever.  Love it.
Glamorous,This is kind of an old fashioned lux soap that you'd picture a circa 50's glamour girl using in a bath tub of bubbles.  The texture is rich and smooth and it feels so rich on your skin.  The soap is free from impurities and much of the chemical enhancements that you find in so many of the bars today.  I have very sensitive skin and this is the type of soap that my doc recommends - it has been a pleasure to try it out and have noticed no redness or dry skin after my bath.  I found this a real treat to use. Glamorous.
Makes a great gift,"I've been buying Pre de Provence items for at least fifteen years, and have always loved their quality.  This is such a nice soap, and the milk scent is a nice, light scent.

While this would make a really lovely gift, it would be nice if it didn't just come loose in the shipping box. The edges of mine were dented in."
"If you love the smell of roses, this bar is for you!","I really enjoyed this rose fragrance soap.  It was a very generous side and smelled just like roses.  I found it best to spin the soap in my wet hands in the shower 10 - 12 times to get a generous amount of soap on my hands.  Because this bar is big, it makes it much easier this way and you get a lot of soap that comes onto your hands when you do this.  Overall, I thought it did a nice job at moisturizing my skin.  I did not feel like my skin was dry or itchy.  If Rose is your smell, then this bar is for you!"
in the lap of luxury.,"This soap goes on as smooth as butter.  Even with the bits of stuff I'm sure is there for exfoliation, I only sense richness.  The floral scent is light, not overpowering, and I don't notice myself wearing it after my shower is done.  The bar is much fatter than standard bars from the grocery store. Even though it feels like it melts in my hands, it actually lasts and lasts.  With this soap, I shower in the lap of luxury."
Milky,"This is wonderful soap. It is so creamy and milky and wonderful. It does have a scent, but in the way plain goat milk soap has a scent. It smells soft and creamy. Not like vanilla. More fresh. It lathers well and leaves skin feeling soft and clean. It almost smells like baby soap, not a baby powder scent, but like high end baby soap. I really like it. The bar is nicely engraved and pretty, as well."
Excellent soap,"Great aromas, great cleaning power, and my Parisian companion says it is a classic French soap.

A bit of Paris in NYC!

Smell I don't personally like,"This seems to be a pretty high quality soap as far as feel goes, and how slowly it disintegrates.  However, I do not love it because I do not like the smell that it has.  It seems way too close to that typical ""man's smell"" that disgraces so many products and dudes all over the world.  I mean, it's definitely a higher end version of this smell than, say, Axe body spray or something terrible like that, but it's in that general realm.  It is possible that this smell comes from a real style soap like this and is later stolen by all the cheap brands, but for better or worse, I still don't like it due to all the cheap brands out there using it."
This soap smells wonderful!,"This soap smells absolutely wonderful. I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.

This soap lathers really well and seems to be fairly hard milled since it isn't shrinking too fast, even with repeated use."
Nice Quality Soap,"I love my soaps and this one is excellent.  It has a nice clean rosemary mint scent that doesn't smell 'fake' as so many do.  There are little bits of mint in the soap you can actually see but won't stick to you when washing.  I prefer French milled because they lather easily and are smooth - cheaper soaps never lather easily and you have to spend forever trying to get enough on your hands.  The shea butter leaves skin moisturized but not sticky or feeling like there is a residue left after exiting the show.  In all, I'm very pleased!"
Smells so good!,"This soap smells soooo good. It lathers decently and the shea butter left my skin feeling soft. I will say, this is more of a spa soap than an I'm ready dirty and need a bath kind of soap. But seriously, the raspberry smells soooo good!"
Very moisturizing for bath and face,"The 150 gram bar of Mint Leaf Pre de Provence Shea Butter Soap is delightful. The soap has little bits of mint leaf in the bar that you can see. The soap is great for bathing with or even washing your face because it has shea butter as part of the ingredients. It also has fragrance added, which helps enhance the aroma from the soap. This is a French milled soap and you can feel the difference when you wash your hands or your body. This is a luxury soap and will make wonderful gifts also. I do not have a single negative thing to say about this soap. The soaps come in 150 and 250 gram sizes. These are the soaps you want to soak in the tub with and enjoy the feel, the scent and the calmness from the scents."
Great smell and a large bar of soap,"Great smell, solid bar of soap that doesn't dry out my skin.  I prefer bar soaps because they last long and because there is no plastic bottle to add to the landfill.  This is a very large bar of soap that if left in a dry area, will last a good amount of time."
Great luxury soap with a lemon scent,"This is a medium-sized bar of hard soap with a pleasant lemon scent. I have sensitive skin, and this soap does not irritate it. Perfect for the tub, sink, or a luxury gift."
"MIrabelle scented soap, smells wonderful and makes my skin feel clean and fresh","Mirabelle scented soap from Pre de Provence smells wonderful! The scent is hard to describe. It smells a little floral and a little spicy on the bar. When I shower with it, I pick up more of a sandalwood scent. The scent is very strong from the bar and I smell it in the bathroom, but it doesn't linger on the skin so it won't clash with your perfume. The soap leaves my skin feeling very clean and it doesn't dry it out.

I've used Pre de Provence soaps in the past and have always had good luck with them. The soap is hard milled and doesn't melt away too quickly. I have a wooden Pre de Provence retail display box that is about 10 years old and it still smells like their soap. My grandmother used to tuck scented soaps in her dresser drawers to keep her linens smelling fresh. This soap would be perfect for that."
Moisturizing Soap,"Soap which is fragrant and moisture rich. The end product is soft, moist skin. the Pre de Provence soaps are wonderful, regardless of scent. They eliminate itchy dry skin and make bath time something to look forward too."
Violette Fragrance is Awesome,"This review is for the 150 g bar of Pre de Provence She Butter Soap with the Violette fragrance.  I absolutely love this scent, and the soap leaves my skin feeling great. I like the size of this bar better than the larger bar, which is too big for my small hands."
Favorite facial soap,Giant bar of French quad milled shea butter soap - milled once more than traditional soaps from Provence.  This is my favorite soap for my face.  It is amazing.  I use it with my Clarisonic and these bars from France last forever.  Love it.
Glamorous,This is kind of an old fashioned lux soap that you'd picture a circa 50's glamour girl using in a bath tub of bubbles.  The texture is rich and smooth and it feels so rich on your skin.  The soap is free from impurities and much of the chemical enhancements that you find in so many of the bars today.  I have very sensitive skin and this is the type of soap that my doc recommends - it has been a pleasure to try it out and have noticed no redness or dry skin after my bath.  I found this a real treat to use. Glamorous.
Makes a great gift,"I've been buying Pre de Provence items for at least fifteen years, and have always loved their quality.  This is such a nice soap, and the milk scent is a nice, light scent.

While this would make a really lovely gift, it would be nice if it didn't just come loose in the shipping box. The edges of mine were dented in."
"If you love the smell of roses, this bar is for you!","I really enjoyed this rose fragrance soap.  It was a very generous side and smelled just like roses.  I found it best to spin the soap in my wet hands in the shower 10 - 12 times to get a generous amount of soap on my hands.  Because this bar is big, it makes it much easier this way and you get a lot of soap that comes onto your hands when you do this.  Overall, I thought it did a nice job at moisturizing my skin.  I did not feel like my skin was dry or itchy.  If Rose is your smell, then this bar is for you!"
in the lap of luxury.,"This soap goes on as smooth as butter.  Even with the bits of stuff I'm sure is there for exfoliation, I only sense richness.  The floral scent is light, not overpowering, and I don't notice myself wearing it after my shower is done.  The bar is much fatter than standard bars from the grocery store. Even though it feels like it melts in my hands, it actually lasts and lasts.  With this soap, I shower in the lap of luxury."
Milky,"This is wonderful soap. It is so creamy and milky and wonderful. It does have a scent, but in the way plain goat milk soap has a scent. It smells soft and creamy. Not like vanilla. More fresh. It lathers well and leaves skin feeling soft and clean. It almost smells like baby soap, not a baby powder scent, but like high end baby soap. I really like it. The bar is nicely engraved and pretty, as well."
Excellent soap,"Great aromas, great cleaning power, and my Parisian companion says it is a classic French soap.

A bit of Paris in NYC!

Smell I don't personally like,"This seems to be a pretty high quality soap as far as feel goes, and how slowly it disintegrates.  However, I do not love it because I do not like the smell that it has.  It seems way too close to that typical ""man's smell"" that disgraces so many products and dudes all over the world.  I mean, it's definitely a higher end version of this smell than, say, Axe body spray or something terrible like that, but it's in that general realm.  It is possible that this smell comes from a real style soap like this and is later stolen by all the cheap brands, but for better or worse, I still don't like it due to all the cheap brands out there using it."
This soap smells wonderful!,"This soap smells absolutely wonderful. I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.

Love At First Shower,Oooh la la! This French soap is fabulous! The fragrance is mild and clean scented. It makes my skin feel silky soft from the shea butter. The large bar should last a long time. This is great quality and would make a good gift too.
Love love love love love the Linden soap!!,"The Linden soap is an absolute delight. OMG it smells so very good. Honestly I'm not really sure what Linden is, but oh, I so love this!
Quality of the soap is high, I find it more delicately scented and just a better quality soap than Lush soaps.
These soaps are great for home use, as a guesting gift, or anything really.
Five stars!"
Deliciously Decadent Soap,"I have used Pre de Provence soaps in the past, and they are absolutely wonderful. There is no comparison to an ordinary bar of soap. They are hard milled, and each bar lasts a long time. The lather is perfect. The scent is delicious and uplifting. And these soaps are packed with so many emollients, they actually moisturize your skin instead of drying it out like a regular bar of soap. The Mirabelle scent is lovely. It is slightly floral and sweet, with an undernote of citrus. I definitely recommend that you try these soaps in the fragrance of your choosing. You won't go back to using supermarket or drugstore brand soaps. There is no comparison. A single bar of this soap,  or a collection of them, make a wonderful gift, too. Enjoy!"
Great soap,This is very high quality soap.  It has a wonderful scent.  It lathers well and rinses clean.  It left my skin feeling moisturized and not the least bit dried out.  It is very good soap!
"My new favorite soap, would be great for gifts.","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap!!! These are thick heavy bars that are beautiful, smell wonderful, and create a nice soft lather. They look and feel luxurious and they're large, so they'll last a long time. I am so impressed. Every one of them (I have several types) is wonderful. The coconut feels especially soft and soothing. The raspberry is a gorgeous color. They leave a faint scent in my bathroom which makes it smell delicious. There is nothing negative to say. I've very pleased. These would be great for gifts."
"Large Bar, Floral but Nice and Clean Smelling","Review for Starflower:

This is a nice bar of soap. It has a hard consistency, not a soft bar so it seems to last longer. The soap provides a lot of suds which makes you feel like you are getting clean. It is a large size too which my husband really loves.

I had never smelled starflower before. The scent of the soap is a floral but not in a heavy or sweet type scent, it smells nothing like roses or magnolias but is just clean floral scent. Im not a big fan of florals and this one is ok, my husband doesnt care for anything girly scented and he doesnt mind this one either."
Inexpensive pampering,"French milled soap and glycerine soaps are a weakness of mine, especially is they are pretty and smell great. This is a great moisturizing formula.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

This formula is skin-friendly and I like that the fragrance is not overpowering. I can't wait to try other fragrances!"
Wonderful soap!,"This is unmistakably French soap. It smells wonderful without being perfumey, it's oversized, and is the most beautiful snowy white.

It lathers well, and leaves skin soft.  It's an excellent soap to travel with, and that marvelous thing, an affordable luxury."
"Gentle, mild and nice scent","I'm new to the Pre de Provence brand, but tried the Green Tea scented Shea Butter soap.  It doesn't have a green tea scent but it does have a light, clean and slightly sweet smell.  The soap feels gentle on the skin. It doesn't lather like commercially produced soap.  The bar doesn't dissolve as quickly as Dove or similar soap."
Minty Fresh - Nice Bar of Soap,"I love Artisanal soaps and pick them up at Whole Foods quite often.  They really help me to feel spoiled and pampered.

Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisinal soap is fancy soap that doesn't cost a  lot of money.  It comes wrapped in a clear cellophane wrapper, which is more than most atisan soaps have.  Many Artisan soaps come without any packaging.

My bar of soap weighs just under 6 ounces.  It's over an inch thick and 3.5 inches long.  Good sized bar of soap.  Mine is mint green with brown flecks.  I am reminded of mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's Rosemary mint.  I love mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions.  The mint is a great eye opener and invigorates tired bones.

The soap lathers up nicely and rinses off well.  I feel no residue.  It looks great in my bathroom.  I would buy this soap if I saw it in the store.  Great fragrance and artisan look."
Soothing,Nice delicious soothing Pre' de Provence soap that leaves your skin clean with mild fragrance to boot.  I can feel the Shea Butter as I larger up the soap and my skin absorbs and reflects the best about the soap.  Highly recommend!
Liked it so well that added to subscribe and save,"Growing up my grandmother always had french milled soap in the guest room and to this day, it reminds me of her. This shea butter enriched version is different - not bad but just different. I actually like the fact it feels soothing and yet leaves skin feeling squeeky clean without any type of residue. This is long lasting but not as much as the standard milled soap I knew growing up. Nice fragrance - not overpowering but present. I actually added a different scent to my subscribe and save since I liked this so well."
"BIG Bars, Great Fragrance, Non-Drying!","These are glorious oversized bars of heaven! I have the green tea version and the fragrance is delicious! It almost has a bit of spiciness to it. Moreover, these leave a clean but not ""stripped"" or dry feeling. And, if you are careful, these won't just melt away in the shower. (If you have a little in-shower case, all the better).

This smells phenomenal, it cleans without drying, and the bars a HUGE! Everything about these is outstanding!

Highly, highly recommended!"
The smell doesn't agree with me,"The soap itself is fine, the scent itself reminds me of old ladies. No offense but I just don't like it at all. This is definitely larger than most finer soaps and the scent doesn't linger too long but it doesn't go away that quickly either. I would give this soap 4 stars if it weren't for the horrible scent."
Such a feeling of luxury!! :),"I will most definitely be back for more! This soap is the most unusual bar soap I have ever used. Just the weight of the bar tells you it is different from anything you've ever picked up in the drug store. The lather is rich, the scent lingers but in a very soft way, and it simply left me feeling so fresh. Slowly but surely, I'll be trying every scent in this line. I'd love to use them as sachet to give that same subtle freshness to my clothing!"
Lime predominates,"This is truly fine soap, and lathers as expected. It has not caused irritation on any user in our circle. The scent is very strong--one expects a slice of Key lime pie in the offing, and it does linger."
Shea Butter Is Great for Moisturizing!,I love soap with shea butter in it. I knew before that it is great for as moisturizer but I looked up and found that it dates back to the times of Cleopatra and actually has many uses like in some ointments. The smell is great but does not linger. I think it is great for everyone who has dry skin.
"Sweet scent, lathers & cleans fine. Too rich for my budget","I have the tiare scent of this bar soap. It's not a scent that I can easily break down. It makes me think of brown sugar, lavender and coco butter. The scent is way too sweet for me, but it doesn't linger long.

The soap itself is smooth and lathers pretty well. It is very soft, feels nice on the skin and does actually clean you off. I found that I needed to rinse a little more than usual to get the last residue of it off though. (We don't have soft water) I like this, but I am not convinced it's any better than a regular soap for a lot less money."
Excellent scents,"I've been using Pre de Provence bar soaps for about six months now and I really like them (my favorites are the verbena and the rosemary mint). This is the first bar of ""Peony"" I've tried and it's very good. Given the name, it's no surprise it's a floral scent; I'd say it leans more feminine than masculine, but I'd also say its unisex if you like soft florals.

The nice thing about all the Pre de Provence soaps I've tried is that the scents are there when you're showering, but they don't linger so strongly that they'll clash with your cologne later on. For the price, they're excellent soaps."
"Wonderful scent, nice performance, non-drying","This has a delightful fragrance! Floral, but much more interesting than the usual floral scents. The performance is also top-notch with a nice amount of lather and a very creamy feel. It does not dry out my skin at all.

The price makes it more of a ""treat"" than an everyday soap, but it's a very nice treat indeed."
Excellent,"This arrived really fast.
At first, I thought that the smell might be too much for a macho dude like me :-) but it didn't linger on me after my shower. Great lather, smoooooth and refreshing, and cleans nicely, even paint primer on my hands.

A good product and it really does smell nice."
"Feels Luxurious, Doesn't Dry Out Sensitive Skin","This PRE DE PROVENCE SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED ARTISANAL FRENCH SOAP BAR (Olive Oil (250 g)) lathers beautifully, and feels luxurious.  It doesn't dry out or irritate my sensitive skin, so I can use it every day.  This is a large 250 gram olive oil bar that gives good value for the money (about $7 on Amazon)."

Now that's a big bar of soap...,"Wow now this is a bar of soap!! This bar is a VERY...very large 12.3 oz sized of soap. The scent is light and I have purchased many Pre De Provence bar soaps over the years. I'm certain that my hubby will enjoy this product due to the size,smell and the fact that many can use this Olive oil & Lavender bar."
Five Stars,as advertised
Four Stars,Still does a great pre shave job.
Voodoo,It really works! This gotta be black magic mixed with voodoo water and chicken cum.
This is a wonderful shower gel that has a delightful lavender scent that ...,"This is a wonderful shower gel that has a delightful lavender scent that is not too strong but delightfully delicate and enjoyable to smell. It lathers nicely and rises off well. My skin feels clean, refreshed, and soft. I love smelling the lingering scent after my shower which creates a pleasant atmosphere for dressing and grooming for my day.

I love it!"
Fragrant Lavender Lotion,"Nice lavender lotion that absorbs easily in my skin. It's not too overpowering scent-wise. The price is fair enough, and this is 10 ounces."
Lavender body lotion:  lightweight moisture; not a fan of this particular lavender scent,"This body lotion is lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly, leaving my skin feeling moisturized but not at all sticky or tacky.  The lavender fragrance is strong at first, but settles into a more subtle scent (though its still very noticeable).  I don't have particularly dry skin, so this is moisturizing enough for me, but if you're looking for a very rich lotion this might be too light for you.

Lavender fragrances vary and I have to say this is not one of my favorites  a bit too perfumey for my taste.  The ingredient list is not impressive, just the typical chemical cocktail you find in most mass market products.  This lotion is just OK  Ill use up the bottle but I doubt Id purchase this in the future."
and the gel lathered nicely and rinsed away without feeling sticky,"This shower gel was decent. The scent was light and not overwhelming, and the gel lathered nicely and rinsed away without feeling sticky. My wife liked the product and commented that it wasn't runny like some of the other pricey gels she's purchased in the past."
"Absorbs quickly, no overpowering scent","Another example of how Amazon throws items together that have nothing to do with each other yet the reviews mix, so it's hard to get an idea of what the review average really means, is it for the lotion, or the water?

THIS review is for the body lotion, which has a slight lavender scent (not too heavy), and is quite creamy.  It goes on evenly and smooth, and absorbs quickly, without any long feeling of greasiness or anything afterwards.  It feels quite nice."
"Very subtle scent, non-resealable bag","I love Pre de Provence soaps, in part because they are powerfully, yet pleasantly fragrant. My bathroom often smells like a spa. Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag. For all of these reasons, but especially the lack of smell, I'm afraid this is one Pre de Provence product I am not able to recommend."
Broken crushed bottle but nice fragrance - light and not overpowering.,"I'm only giving this a neutral rating because it smelled lovely but arrived crushed, leaking and unable to be used. Very nice light fragrance - non irritating which is unusual as I tend to have a lot of allergies. This is not overpowering. Has an almost romantic and nostalgic fragrance."
good natural scent,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it."
Basic shower gel-scores high points for compact packaging and smell,"This is a very basic, gentle shower gel that earns high marks for it's compact, minimal waste packaging and the lovely smell of lavender. I have used a lot of lavender products before and this one is the best. I got this as a freebie, I full intend to buy some when this runs out. I have found my new favorite!"
"Fresh, clean, spicy","This lavender water is very floral and spicy, yet when it is dispersed as spray on our sheets, it is very delicate.  Such a pretty color, too.

It is not a sweet or cloying scent, and is a natural, clean and fresh scent.

Just to test its clarity, I sprayed it on my face.  It just evaporated as I expected it to, leaving no sticky feeling.

I do not have the Pre de Provence spray bottle, just picked up a small 8 ounce spray bottle from the drug store.  Any spray bottle with a very fine mister will do.

This is a plastic bottle."
"Just ""meh"" in my opinion","Smells good but doesn't contain any real lavender essential oil.  I also found it to be drying.  Soon as I dried off I could feel the skin on my legs tightening up.  Now, I use moisturizing creams, butters, lotions or oils everyday but I still don't want to use a drying body wash.  Why stress my skin unnecessarily?  For that reason, I wouldn't buy this again."
Pretty Light Scent,"This has a pretty lavender fragrance. It's not overpowering. Instructions suggest using the linen water in an iron. I don't like to iron, so I put some in a spray bottle and lightly sprayed it on my sheets. There's nothing like lavender to relax you. THis large bottle should last a long time."
Lavender is one of my favorite scents - it even soothes my migraines somewhat,"Lavender is one of my favorite scents - it even soothes my migraines somewhat. This is not too strong, but it does make things smell just a bit nicer and fresher. Not that fake, sickening fragrance of some of the other brands, either."
Smells Good But Doesnt Last,"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

~ Kort"
Touch of Lavender,I love the aroma of lavender and was sure this was going to have a stronger lavender scent.  It did have a faint hint of lavender scent.  That was a disappointment.  The scent lasts all of a hot second once it leaves the bottle.  I discovered that if you pour 2-3 capfuls in your laundry and pour a capful on a washcloth in your bathroom you get the benefit of the lavendar aroma.
"Dull color, not a lot of scent in the dried lavender","I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms."
Lavender blossoms: smell amazing and bag will last for a long time,"Dried Lavender Blossoms? Amazing! If I had known that you could buy these, I would have purchased them a long time ago. We love the smell of lavender in our house. It is probably the top scent that we buy in all candles, waxes, etc. My original plan was to use this like potpourri. When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible. I like to use them in my sock and underwear drawers.

These lavender blossoms are high quality and will last for a long time. I highly recommend them if you want your house to smell like lavender."
Smells Amazing,"This lavendar water smells amazing. I put it in a spray bottle to spritz my bed linens to freshen them up a bit. I do wish it came with a spray top, although then it wouldn't look as nice, but it would be more functional, at least for my uses. I'm really happy with this product. Smells great. No allergy issues."
Mostly water.,Barely any scent. And it doesn't smell like a lavender. I don't like it.
Wonderful lavender scent,"I am a bath person.  I always have been.  I love floral bath salts (not the kind that get you in trouble), and this fits the bill perfectly.  The lavender scent is light and refreshing, surrounding you with a pleasing aroma.  The salts dissolve completely, not leaving gritty residue behind."
wonderul light French Lavender blossom spray,"I can remember watching my grandma iron clothes. She used a lavender scented spray, and sometimes starch. The clothes also usually smelled of the fresh outside as we hung our clothes on a line. She would let me spray and iron the hankies and pillow cases. To this day the scent of lavender brings back such happy memories.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

also very nice spritzed lightly on the bed a half hour or so before going to bed leaves a clean, lavender sleep experience.

Truly something I'll be buying once this bottle is gone, although given how little it takes the bottle will last a while."
"Too weak, scent dissipates too fast","Lavender water.

This has a nice scent and the sprayer sprays well, but it is so weak that the scent disappears within a few minutes If I spray more, the sheets get damp. I received a free bottle in exchange for an honest review and I was pretty excited about having lavender-scented sheets, but I won't be buying any of this item and can't recommend it. I have tried this company's soaps, though, and they are wonderful!"
Dried lavender blossoms,"These lavender blossoms are similar to those that local lavender farms sell in our nearby green market.  It comes out a little more expensive than when purchased from the growers, but it is just as fragrant and reasonably priced."
Clear Gel Creates Nice Lather With Delicate Lavender Scent,"Lavender is my favorite soap fragrance, so it's no surprise that I love this PRE DE PROVENCE FRENCH LAVENDER BATH & SHOWER GEL.  For the shower, a pump or two is enough for a nice lather, and the lather washes off easily.

The lavender fragrance is delicate, and it lingers for only a short time.  It doesn't overwhelm perfume, aftershave lotion, shampoo, or other scented products you may like to use.  The clear gel arrives in an attractive square pump dispenser.

The shower gel leaves my skin silky smooth, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin."
Leaves a nice clean scent,I'm personally not a huge fan of lavender scents but this one isn't bad. My wife uses it to freshen up our guest rooms when we have visitors and it's not overpowering. It actually leaves a nice subtle scent and reinforces that the place is clean. She's used it in the dryer to de-wrinkle blouses just before going out.
Theis review is for Pre de Provence lavender bath salts,"These bath salts do smell like real lavender, and turn bathing into a luxurious experience.  They would make a nice but inexpensive holiday gift."
nice scent,"This has a very nice scent and works well in your drawers, but you do have to put them in a mesh bag b/c they are small and can get messy.  The scent lasts a long time.  Overall, very nice for my clothing drawers."
"LOVE the lavender, rich indulgence","Beautiful lavender crystals that smell heavenly.  Bath salts dissolve quickly in hot water turning the bath water the palest shade of lavender.  Such a lovely indulgence for your everyday bath.  I love having little rituals like this one that makes me feel like a super wealthy spa girl :-)  I have some of the Pre De Provence soaps and it is an amazing way to step out of regular, messy, hard life for a few minutes.  Yep, a low cost escape until I can go to the fields of France and see the lavender for myself."
Potpourri material,"I'm reviewing the dried lavender blossoms. The scent is wonderful, so long as you like the scent of lavender -- and I do. I mix this with some dried flower petals and use it as potpourri in the restroom. It's not an immediately overwhelming scent, but when you walk into the room, it smells very nice. In the fall, I'm going to mix it with some ground cloves.

I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not overpriced, but it's not a steal, either. Overall, though, I'm happy with it."
Heavenly fragrance,"Who doesn't love the fragrance of lavender?  This is a large cellophane bag of the dried blooms, which look a bit like brown rice.  The fragrance is strong, even before opening the bag.  Little bowls of this placed around the house provide a lovely fresh atmosphere without being overpowering.  The 5.3 ounces is about two cups.

If you're looking for dried flower blooms for scented decorations, this isn't your product.  It's not pretty, but it does smell wonderful.  I'm waiting for someone to ask why I have a dish of rice on my coffee table!"
Imparts lovely scent,"I never considered a scented water for ironing or steaming my clothes until I saw this product.  What a great idea!  I added this to my garment steamer as well as my steam iron and both impart a lively French Lavender scent that remains long enough to get noticed.  My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Overall - this is a nice product which lends a nice fragrance to my clothing.  I would recommend it."
So Fresh and Inviting!,"What a fabulous way to spread the clean, inviting fragrance of Lavender throughout your home. I have never tried a product like this before, but now I know it is an absolute must-have. It has so many uses. You can definitely use it on clean linens, but I also use it to freshen things like the bathroom rug and the shower curtain between washings. You can use this delightful spray on pretty much anything you can spray water on. It's great sprayed in drawers and in closets, too. The smell is so light and fresh, I even caught my granddaughter using it to slightly dampen her hair before using the curling iron! What a smart girl. I absolutely adore the Pre De Provence product line. Everyone of them is made with high quality and wonderful scents. This Lavender Blossom Water is no exception. It's a nice way to bring a touch of Provence into your own home."
Very Pungent Lavender Bath Salts - Great For Relaxing After a Long Day,"I am reviewing the Bath Salts.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender bath salts come in a plastic 19 ounce container with a screw lid.  There is no protective seal on the product bottle.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

The only reason I subtracted a star is because I had to give my tub an extra rinse after taking my Lavender incensed bath with these salts."
Much neater on the counter,"I generally use Crest but the children like Colgate better.  I like that it is a kids' toothpaste so I don't have to stand over them to make them spit out.  It also tastes all right so they don't go kicking and screaming.  Well they do, but not because of the toothpaste.

The best thing about these is that they are standup pumps.  Before these arrived we had about five different toothpaste tubes on the counter.  They were making me grit my teeth."
Makes a difference,"One of the things that we are working on with my grandson is to make sure he takes better care of his teeth.
Part one was a better toothbrush, part two was finding a toothpaste that he really likes and is willing to brush
the full two minutes with.

With this toothpaste he likes the taste and the texture and brushes the full two minutes, encouraged of course by his
Talking Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles toothbrush.
He doesn't like the minty toothpastes that the adults in the house prefer, but adores the fruity bubblegum flavor
of the Colgate Kids Maximum Cavity Protection.

Based on the changes in brushing behavior I have seen, I would recommend both this toothpaste and also
https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-Teenage-Turtles-Talking-Toothbrush/dp/B01613YHQC/ref=cm_rdp_product"
Pump!/No More Cap!,"If you have found the top off the tube of toothpaste like I have, you know this pump is a great idea.  My grandkids sometimes ""forget"" to put the cap back on the toothpaste, so this is perfect.  The pump works great and the kids love it!"
Great for Growing Teeth,"I was relieved to find out the flavor is a mild fruity bubblegum. I once bought a bubblegum flavor toothpaste because it was on sale and the flavor was overpowering. I ended up throwing it away. But this flavor is fine.

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

It also has a good tip on conserving water. I knew that it saves water to turn off the tap when you are brushing but I had no idea that it can save up to 4 gallons of water."
Excellent,"Good stuff. I've always been a fan, and while I'm waaaay past the intended age group I use it anyway. Good taste, cleans he teeth wonderfully, and simply does what it's supposed to."
Good kids' toothpaste,"My kids (5 and 7) really like this toothpaste.  They said it tastes better than the ""adult stuff"" that we usually use.  The pump top is nice b/c it sits firmly on the counter and makes it easier to get some on the brush head without making a big mess like they do with the squeeze tubes.  Overall, very good for the kiddos"
Bubble gum flavor,"This toothpaste is a translucent gel with the sweet flavor and fragrance of old-fashioned bubble gum.  It is green rather than pink, which seems just as odd to me as purple ketchup.

The convenient pump dispenses the correct pea-sized dose that is recommended for brushing.  Children should still be supervised to make sure that they don't swallow the toothpaste to avoid fluoride toxicity.

The plastic container stands upright and holds 4.4 oz. or 124 g.  It has a cap that is easy to remove and replace but which smears any excess toothpaste left on the pump dispenser.  The dispenser opens and closes automatically so that the cap is not needed in routine use.  The safety-sealed containers that I received have an expiration date 16 months from receipt.

Inactive ingredients:  Sorbitol, water, hydrated silica, PEG-12, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, flavor, sodium saccharin, mica, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 1."
My Kids Brush Longer and More Often,"I'm a mom that likes to purchase in volume so this works for me.  The 6 tubes come in a sturdy box so I can take one out and stow the rest in an organized fashion.

Personally, I am not a bubblegum toothpaste enthusiast.  It's way too sweet tasting and too 'dramatic' for me early in the morning.  The kids though love this toothpaste.  Even the teens are more enthusiastic about brushing because of the flavor.

I know some moms don't like fluoride, but our kids have a weak enamel problem and fluoride is a must.

"Convenient pump, mild bubblegum flavor","My eight-year-old daughter, who already has braces, is very picky about her toothpaste. Fortunately she likes the flavor of this Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste. Described as ""mild bubble fruit,"" she just calls it bubblegum. I tried some myself and it is indeed mild. It reminded me of the bubblegum-flavored paste I used as a kid, though I didn't get any fruit flavors. Regardless, it's mild enough that even my picky kid - who hates ""spicy"" paste - liked this.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

It's been years since I've used a pump, and I forgot how much I liked them. This is virtually mess free, with a red button easy enough for my daughter to use in her own. All in all, I was extremely impressed by this toothpaste and might even use it from time to time myself. Recommended."
"it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the","My daughter, a verified kid, won't use adult toothpaste.  She almost refused to use Colgate Kids toothpaste because it looks so much like adult toothpaste.  Hint to the makers: Your design team really needs to step up to the plate.  Throw some color on that tube!

After I convinced her to use the toothpaste, she was quite happy.  Bubblegum (ahem, bubble fruit) isn't her favorite flavor, but she says it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the pump action because it's less mess than traditional tubes.  Yes, the pump and the rocket stand are definite pluses.  No more toothpaste all over the sink.  She still uses the toothpaste without complaint, so it's a thumbs up from her."
Offers Many Benefits For Growing Adult Teeth,"Colgate is my favorite brand of toothpaste.  I and my family always use Optic White.  This review is for Maximum Cavity Protection for growing adult teeth, which is a new concept.  The toothpaste comes in a stand up container that has a press style pump.  You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

The toothpaste tastes good and offers some serious benefits for growing adult teeth.  Perfect for my 19 year old daughter!"
Love the taste!,"This toothpaste tastes fantastic!  It tastes like pink bubblegum, but it's green.  The tube is large, so it will last a long time,  The toothpaste is forced out, so there isn't any squeezing involved.  This makes it nice for kids, because you don't have, half squeezed tubes lying around.  My teeth felt very clean after using this.  I am not a fan of mint, but it is hard to find a toothpaste that isn't mint.  This one tastes great!  I love it!  It makes brushing fun!"
Kids Like the Flavor and the Pump,"My kids love using the Colgate pumps. I think it just seems fun to them and they are easier for kids to operate than having to squeeze tubes. I do feel like the pumps leave a little bit left in the bottom though so you get a little bit less product with them. The pumps are definitely less messy though.

Our order came as 6 pumps of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection in mild bubble fruit flavor. The toothpaste is a blue gel. Its slightly fruity but still minty. All 6 pumps had an expiration date of 10/2017 (this is 8/2016) so the expiration date is over a year out - plenty of time to use all 6 pumps. All the pumps have a safety seal on the pump that has to be broken off so you know they are sealed and safe.

The kids really like this flavor and the pump."
Five Stars,"great smell, and work better than the bad stuff. go figure."
Awesome Gift!,I love this refreshing eye cream! My sister bought a bottle and I totally noticed a difference in her eye skin and bags. Her skin lightened and brightened and was so much less puffy so I went for it.
Liked it,"Great product. I tried several products for my darkness/puffiness under my eyes, and this nel did a pretty good job so far. Do not expect miracles, but this is pretty damn close to it!"
Like it,"Exelent product! Generous amount in the packaging, can be used all over the face. Will buy in the future."

"Great formula, my daughter loves the color","Essie has always been a trusty polish for me, and my little girl loves this truly sweet and girly pink. It's just... pretty. Fairy Tailor is the cutest name for it. Best of all, it truly does have a quality look similar to gel polish. Very well done, this formula."
15 year old daughter's review,"15 year old daughter says:
-- nice color!
-- color is not opaque, so it takes multiple coats
-- gel coat is really nice, goes on smooth, makes it look like a gel finish
-- does not last 14 days"
"Beautiful color, great shine, staying power","Rock The Runway: Beautiful Red Color, does not disappoint!

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

Beautiful color!!!"
Rockin' your Mani,"Rock the runway is a bright red that reminds me of a fire engine red. It goes on like a cream polish, nothing iridescent or glittery. It's that classic red but slightly updated by being a little less muted. This one stands out.
And this is one of the absolute best top coats out there, at any price. The only way to get a better one, in my opinion, is if you use a UV gel, and who wants to spend nearly 20 minutes soaking in pure acetone in order to remove a UV gel?
I find that this polish and topcoat removes quickly with acetone, and less quickly with a non acetone polish remover.
The top coat also makes any little streaks or flaws in the polish disappear."
You can't go wrong with Essie!,"Rock the Runway is a simple, all purpose classic, pure bright but not overly-bright red. A Crayola red. A sharp choice for Christmas, Fourth of July, or even Valentine's Day. Creamy, opaque, quick drying and long wearing.  Just a great one.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.  This is one of several reds I own, and it's one of my favorites."
Excellent set,"Great applicator brushes. Great color. Great polish (definitely lasts longer than less expensive brands). Great top coat. The results are salon-worthy. If this set were a little less expensive, it would be a steal and therefore a no-brainer five-star item. Still, it's a very good polish set and easily worthy of four stars."
Rock this red,"Rock the Runway is another winning red from the Essie Gel Couture line. I love the wide, curved brush which makes application effortless. I also love the fact that it doesn't need a base coat, and dries incredibly fast.
It's the cheeriest of cherry reds, bright, bold and yet classic.
I get pretty long wear time, not 14 days but still longer than a traditional polish on my working fingers. And even then, it's usually because of tip wear or grow out, not because the polish has chipped.
For the price, this is my go to polish. Love it!!"
Definitely recommended!,"This is a great little two piece kit that goes on so nicely with a great applicator brush. I adore the fact that it dries so quickly, because I always seem to be in a hurry to go on to the next task I have to do. The color is neutral and seems to blend along with any other color you might wear. I'm particularly excited to wear it along with Autumn shades, but it'll be good any time of year. Love it!"
"Shiny, Long Lasting, Lovely Look!","Set aside about forty minutes and take your time with this. So, I waited for my favorite tv show to come on (so I wouldn't be tempted to walk around while waiting for my toes to dry) and began. In total, this is a three step process: apply a coat of color and wait, apply a second coat of color and wait, and finally apply the gel coat and wait. If you take your time, the end product is lovely! Nice color and super shiny!

Now, I know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. Avoid this. By following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. Trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. So, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. So, win-win!

This is a hearty polish! It does not chip easily and lasts over one week on fingernails and at least two on toenails! So, this is worth the price.

A fantastic combo! Recommended!"
"Smooth, applies well, but took 4 coats to build up color","Review by my teen daughter:
Goes on smoothly, but it took 4 coats for the color to show up and be even slightly opaque. Lasts about a week before chipping."
"Pretty, but really not gel-like","This set contains a nail polish and a topcoat, which are meant to give the appearance of a gel manicure.  They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!"
Eleven days of wear (from someone who is sooooo hard on her nails!),"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.  Love these!!!!"
Lovely shade for winter or summer - VIPlease,"I don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. Great product!"
"Long lasting, great color","This review is for essie Gel Couture Nail Polish set with the 144-inside scoop and platinum grade finish top coat.  ""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend."
"Only got 4 day wear, beautiful color","I love essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of it. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light). Nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no cure.

Because I can get a much longer wear than my regular polish I say this is a win. A girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

Beautiful color!!!"
"Great colors and goes on beautifully, but seems to last about as long as most other polishes.","The polish looks amazing when you first apply it. It has a beautiful shine to it and goes on so smoothly. And compared to my other essie polishes I've used for the past few years, it does seem to stay a little longer without chipping. But I've yet to get 14 days of chip-free wear from it. I can usually get about 3 days before I start to see the first chip. I then touch it up with some polish and put a new topcoat on and that will get me another day, but after that it's chipping badly enough that I need to redo my nails. It's a pretty polish and worth picking up if it's available in a color you love, but it's by far not at all the most chip-free polish I've used."
Gel couture LOVE,"Love this shade of deep purple. The coverage is rich, you can get away with one coat just fine, but two coats is perfection. With the included top coat, shiny, protected nails. I get about 5 days of wear time, with minimal tip wear and zero chips. After that it's not bad at all, I'm just ready for a change.
And changing the Essie gel couture is easy breezy, regular polish remover and done. Plus, it dries fast - so much to love!!"
The. Best. Ever.,"If I could give this duo six stars, I would. The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
Getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.
If your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on."
Wearing hue?,"Review update:

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively."
Color doesn't look good on,Way to light. You have to put on 4 coats and it still doesn't look very good. It looks nice in the bottle but it's too pale on your fingers and toes.
Great Nail Finish,"This must be applied with caution following the instructions exactly and with great care. Essie polish is top quality and it lasts fairly long after a manicure. It does not crack or chip, and the color is true and brilliant.
I thought this amethyst/purple might be a bit goth, but turns out that it is perfect for Halloween when I get dressed up in full witch regalia. I normally do my nails with OPI, but I love the long lasting finish."
Quick drying,"This set of nail polish and top coat works really well for me.  I usually don't put nail polish - my constant typing on the computer keyboard, the cooking and dishwashing all cause the polish to chip very quickly.

This time, I tried the Essie polish and top coat kit. I have color ""Inside Scoop"" which is a light pink that looks even lighter when applied. The pink has slight orchid undertones. It looks polished and not too sweet.  It goes on easily and the topcoat dries and protects.  It is easy to apply and dried fast so I didn't have to deal with smudges."
"Nice, long-wearing nail polish","I have loved the essie line of nail polish for years just for their sheer, wearable colors which go well-beyond their cult classic, ballet slippers. I was curious to see if this gel polish could be as a good as the gel manicures available in salons. My conclusion: It's very close. The pros: This polish goes on smoothly and dries so quickly. The special oval-like brush gives excellent results. The gel top coat has a strong smell, but it does leave my nails looking like they have just been polished. Usually two days in there is a slight dullness and even some chipping, but I have seen none of that. I got this as a freebie, but I would gladly buy this. It's a great way to get a salon-like manicure in 15 minutes of actual polishing time. (And I didn't use anything to speed up the process.)"

This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash.

Not Available anymore!!!,This is one of the BEST shampoos for swimmers. I always got complements on my hair since I started using this product. Unavailable now.
love this product,Use regularly. love this product.
Good hair product for dry coarse hair,Have been using the product since I got my first as a gift and I like it.  I have dry coarse hair and it helps to soften it and take away the dullness.
Five Stars,Best shampoo/conditioner hands down
Four Stars,Love this stuff.
Best shampoo I've ever used!,My male roommate and I both love this shampoo! My hair looks healthy and never dry or frizzy when I use it consistently. All the Theorie products I have used have been excellent and do exactly what they promise. I would recommend it to anyone!
Five Stars,I love this product. Really makes my hair moisturized and silky
Excellent product!,By far the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have used.  As someone with very thick and dry hair it has given me back the shine and texture I craved.
Really improves the condition of your hair,"This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me ""no charge for the chemical cut!"" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie."
Five Stars,"Yeah, the huge size!!!  This stuff has changed my naturally curly hair!"
Four Stars,nice
Awesome product for frizzy hair,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair
Best stuff ever,Best stuff ever!  Makes my hair less frizzy when using with a flat iron.  Makes it soft & silky.  Highly recommend!
This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon ...,"This product is a great deal. They don't sell this in the salon anymore, you can only find it online. It is a great product if you are looking for a shine. It did not work well as an anti-frizz product."
Good stuff,"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone."
Five Stars,just what I wanted and at a great price
Love this product!,Love this stuff! Works great when flat ironing my hair and it smells great!
Five Stars,Works great!
I have used this product for years. It is ...,I have used this product for years. It is the only one that controls the frizz on humid days.

Beautiful and Unusual Hair Decor,"Looks very well-made and colors are rich.  A bit larger than I expected (shame on me for not looking at dimensions), but I think it will look lovely in my daughter's hair."
Five Stars,love them
Highly recommend!,"I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!"
flawless,"This pressed powder goes on like silk, so light weight but covers well. I don't like to use a heavy powder that shows all the wrinkles, this one is just right!"
Five Stars,My favorite powder!

Very Clean Scent,I get more compliments when I wear this lotion!!!
Best Ever,I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.
